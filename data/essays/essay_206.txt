        Falling in love, @CAPS3 @CAPS1 The falling part was easy, I remember the minute I fell in love with you. Everything about you shined, everything about you sparkled. You were infinitely beautiful in my eyes. We had the most fun that human beings were capable of. Every time we were together there was no thought in my mind that we were not happy together, no worry that you would ever leave. I never wanted to imagine life without you. As a child i had always had the title of the kid who smiles all the time, @CAPS4 when i thought of you i got this glow. Everybody saw it. they would ask, "@CAPS2 have you been doing? Your so happy, I've never seen you like this before." That, @CAPS2 they saw in me was the power of love. @CAPS4 something they did not see was @CAPS2 we had together. When it was just me @CAPS3 you @CAPS3 one of us would do something @CAPS3 neither of us could stop the laughter. When our stomachs hurt from @CAPS1 so hard. that is @CAPS2 I love, I grew to love every part of you. Especially your laugh.  From @CAPS2 i hear, they say the laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I would have to agree. Being able to laugh with someone, @CAPS3 being able to be yourself @CAPS3 not have to hold up this front, its magical. Its something that makes a relationship last. I guess its kinda like glue in sense. My brother @CAPS3 i are the closest you can get to best friends, @CAPS3 guess @CAPS2 we do in our spare time? We laugh. Hes someone that i can be silly @CAPS3 dumb @CAPS3 goofy with @CAPS3 he still laughs, @CAPS3 he still loves me. :) @CAPS4, although he is my brother it still holds the same respect, @CAPS1 is great. It is also a stress reliever. My teacher told me so. My health teacher that is.
