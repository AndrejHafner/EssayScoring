 Laughter. Something everyone does. Its natural, organic, normal. They say children laugh more than adults, maybe that's @CAPS6 keeps them children. They can still let that deep instinct to enjoy themselves be expressed in bursts of happy noise. Laughter is always unique to every person. Some have musical laughs, others have deep belly laughs. Then there @CAPS10 those or snort or snicker, the kind of laugh that makes @CAPS8 laugh because @CAPS8 hear it. Those @CAPS10 my favorite. Someone once said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people" and I couldn't agree more. Laughing with people has been the greatest influence in my relationships with my friends. I have five girlfriends that I would not be able to live without. They support me, love me, and get me to be bold and get out of my comfort zone. There have been many sleepovers where at two in the morning all @CAPS8 here is the laughter of all of us at some shocking @TIME1 confession or horror at the "would @CAPS8 rather?" someone just came up with. One @TIME1 in particular was especially funny. It was last @DATE1 and we were sleeping on @ORGANIZATION1's porch. It was a spectacular @TIME1, the stars were out the air was cool but comfortable and a meteor shower was happening later on that evening. @PERSON3 started the conversation with her favorite catch phrase, "@CAPS1 guys, hows life?" We all @CAPS16 because if @CAPS8 @CAPS10 around @PERSON3 for more than and hour @CAPS8 will here this saying a @CAPS2 times.  "@CAPS3 as five minutes ago," I replied.  "@CAPS4 guys my life has completely changed," said @PERSON1 sarcastically. "@CAPS5 really?" @LOCATION1 asked, her little body curled up in her sleeping bag, "@CAPS6 have @CAPS8 had a personality flip, @CAPS11 @CAPS8'@CAPS20 now blond and stupid?"  "@CAPS7." @PERSON1 said sarcastically, rolling her eyes, a very @ORGANIZATION1 gesture. We @CAPS16 at the ridiculous mental picture of "the brain"being stupid.  "@CAPS8 guys want to play would @CAPS8 rather?" @ORGANIZATION2 piped in. I had thought she was asleep by now. All I could see was her red hair covering her face. "@CAPS9!" yelled @PERSON2, "I can't handle my mind being filled with horrible mental pictures!" she buried her face in her pillow trying to block the images. "@CAPS10 @CAPS8 sure? I have some new ones." @PERSON1 said with her best evil voice, "@CAPS11 would @CAPS8 rather have to..." "@CAPS9!" we all yelled together and the laughter ensued.  "@CAPS13 or @CAPS14?" @PERSON3 suggested. An unintelligible noise came from @ORGANIZATION2's pillow. "@CAPS6 did @CAPS8 say?" I asked. She raised her sleepy eyed face. "I'@CAPS23 too lazy, and unless the @CAPS14 is to be the first one asleep then I'@CAPS23 not playing!" she dropped her head back onto her pillow.  "I agree," @LOCATION1 added, "I'@CAPS23 too lazy."  "@LOCATION1 it would take @CAPS8 four hours just to get out off this porch cause @CAPS8'@CAPS20 so @CAPS21." @CAPS16 @PERSON1. "@PERSON1 I'@CAPS23 not @CAPS21. I'@CAPS23 @CAPS17!"  "@CAPS5 just accept it @LOCATION1, @CAPS8'@CAPS20 @CAPS21!" "@CAPS9 @PERSON1 I'@CAPS23 @CAPS17!"We continued @CAPS11 this, bantering back and forth till slowly people began to fall asleep, drifting off in the cool @TIME1 air. I was the last awake, and as I watched the meteor shower I had a sudden epiphany. My life was pretty awesome right now.  It was @DATE1, @CAPS9 school, @CAPS9 stress. I was laying on a porch watching a meteor shower listening the @TIME1 sounds and feeling perfectly safe, and I had the best five friends I could ever wish for. We joked and @CAPS16 with each other, but this is the first step to being so comfortable with people that @CAPS8 can tell them everything. Laughing with someone breaks the ice, it brings us closer together. Laying there I suddenly realized that because of all of our joking I felt comfortable enough with these girls to tell them just about everything, and I wanted to. I had never felt @CAPS11 this before. That I could do anything because there were five people that had my back through anything. I smiled to myself and as I closed my eyes I imagined all of the laughter I would get to enjoy with these friends.
