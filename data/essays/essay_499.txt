@PERSON1                               @CAPS1 @CAPS2 One @DATE1 of @DATE1 break me and a @CAPS3 went @CAPS1 with my @CAPS5 on the boat in @LOCATION1. We have been waiting all week for to go catch some @DATE1 @CAPS4 salmon. That @DATE3 @TIME1 we had to get the boat ready so we can leave that day. Our boat is big so we just put all our stuff in it, like sleeping bags, coolers of food, and all the @CAPS1 gear we would need for salmon. we also brought a camp stove for our food we make on the boat. There was also another guy named @PERSON2 but we call him big @PERSON2 hes very funny guy that provided a lot of laughter on the boat.When we get there we had to stop at a bait shop to get some prawns and spinner blades, that's what we use to catch the salmon.  We leave and soon as we get to the boat ramp were we launch the boat my @CAPS5 realizes that he forget to get hooks while we were at the shop. So we pull the boat out of the water, luckily the boat was still on the trailer, we get all the stuff all secure in the boat again and leave to the shop. Right as we get to the bait place the lady we talk to earlier said we forgot to grab the hooks we bought, some how we did forget I don't know how though. So we say thanks and headed back to the river. We finally get our boat in the water and head up river to were we are going to do our @CAPS1, and it is a popular place there would be a line of boats called a hog line and some how we would always some how get in the middle where the best @CAPS1 is. There would be some days usually @DATE2 like @NUM1 boats on each side of us and it got hectic and some times funny because some of the guys out there don't even know how to operate a boat.  When we got there after we geared our poles up we put them out in the water, my pole went down and hooked a nice bright @CAPS4 and fought him for about fifth teen minutes and my @CAPS5 netted it and it was a keeper fish. After all that my @CAPS5 said that was a small fish. Right around dark we reeled are poles in and put them away neatly in the boat. Right when it got dark it was time for bed and it was quite on the river there was no one on the river besides so we didn't have to worry about other people rocking our boat while we were sleeping. The next morning was cold and windy but luckily we brought our top to cover us from getting wind burn, because last time we went we got wind burnt so bad it hurt for about a week. finally my buddies pole goes down and hes all excited about hooking a fish, about ten minutes go by and he realizes he hooked on a log that floated by, me and my @CAPS5 knew he hooked on it but we didn't want to say any thing because it would be funny him getting all excited. My @CAPS5's pole goes down and it was fish on, so i throw the anchor out we float down get it in the net another fish too take home and we had two in the boat but my buddy is the only one that needs to get a fish so we all have one to take home.  After all day of being on the boat it was about time to head off home and get ready for the begging of the week. Right about two o clock, I look over my pole tip slams to the water another fish on hand it to my buddy he's fighting it, he was having trouble reeling though because the drag was tight but then i fix it he gets in the boat, his first salmon ever he was happy. perfect timing, because about fifteenth minutes later we leave to go home. the @CAPS2 was fun we got some fish, we had some funny moments, and most of all I got my buddy his first salmon.
