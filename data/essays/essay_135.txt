It was a normal day, I had just woken up, because my friend @PERSON2 who had called me wondering if I wanted to hangout.I said yes and I went and took a shower and got ready. Once I was ready I called him back and asked him where he wanted to hangout at. He told me that he wanted me to go over to kyle house and play basketball.When I got there everyone was over there so we decied to have a big game of basketball.I was on the better team and already knew we were going to win, but every single shot I took I missed and it was really embarresing, but my team ended up winning which was no suprise.After the game we all were tired and went inside to play video games. We played @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM1, we took turns and on my turns I did really bad because I dont really play video games so everyone laughed at me including myself.As soon as we were done playing I got a @CAPS1 from a bunch of girls who were going to the movies that night, and wanted to know if everyone and I wanted to go.Everyone decied to go, and we all wanted to see the movie paranormal activity @NUM1, so we were pretty excited and before the movie started we all went over to @PERSON1 house and hungout with all the girls.We all sat in the living room listening to music while most of the girls were up stairs getting ready.I was bored so I went up stairs to hangout with the girls and let me tell you it was a bad idea because the second I walked up there they all wanted me to let them straighten my hair or let them put makeup on me.So I went back down stairs and warned everyone not to go up there.They asked why and when I told them they all laughed and some of them went up there anyway and came back with makeup on I laughed so hard that i fell off the couch.Once I finaly stopped laughing it was time to go and her mom drove us there but there was not enough seats in the car so me and all the girls we cramed into the front seat and the reast of the guys were in the back seat, so I was pretty happy.When we got in the movie theater there was a pretty long line but it was worth it.Suprisingly the moive was acutaly kinda scary it made me jump like five times.When we drove home it was like @NUM3 and @PERSON3 and I walked home from her house and the whole way back he was freaking out and it made me laugh and it made him laugh how I was kinda freaked out too.I think that it was a really fun day because I was laughing through most of it.
