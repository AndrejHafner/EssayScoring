  Sence I was a little girl I' ve lived without my bio mom, @CAPS1 gave me up for adaption when @CAPS1 was only @NUM1, @CAPS1 wasn't ready @CAPS8 be a mom. @CAPS1 has always been a risk taker an never thought about her concequences. My adoptive parents have always been truthful @CAPS4 me about her an why @CAPS1 gave me up. I accept how my life has turned out an im very grateful, @CAPS2 i wasn't adopted i wouldnt have gotton @CAPS8 know my @PERSON1, The most loving, adventurous, funny, wise women you would ever meet. As soon as i could walk @PERSON1 would have me out camping and hiking @CAPS4 her. @CAPS2 @CAPS6 was a nice sunny day no one would have any doubt were we would be. @CAPS2 we were at @PERSON1's house in the @DATE1 or @DATE2 we would always be out in her garden boy how @PERSON1 @CAPS3 her gardens and flowers. No wait thats a lie @PERSON1 @CAPS3 nature period.  @CAPS1 has taught me how @CAPS8 appreciate everything around me exspecially nature, @CAPS4 me an her we are closer then anything you could think of, @CAPS2 shes the sky im her stars, @CAPS2 i' m a bird @CAPS1's my wings. @CAPS6's that simply. @CAPS6 hasn't always been easy for her an me, but the way we know how @CAPS8 cope is @CAPS8 laugh at everything an everyone, not in a bully or make fun of kind a way, but a good way. Laughin for me an my @PERSON1 comes like a second nature @CAPS8 us, @CAPS6's what keeps us going an know that everything will be okay. A few months ago my favorite cousin @CAPS7 had passed away, @PERSON1 and I had barley seen each other in a while or had talked, but then everything happend so fast @CAPS4 @PERSON2. That when we saw each other @CAPS6 was at his funeral. My sizemore family was all there, even tho @PERSON2 was gone he had a presence that was still there. That night after the funeral everyone went @CAPS8 my aunties house an just spent time together. Finally @PERSON1 and I got the chance @CAPS8 talk yes we were both teary eyed but we were laughing @CAPS8.We were laughin at all the funny times we had @CAPS4 @PERSON2 an all the crazy things he did. One time he had went @CAPS8 go get my uncle from the airport an he was waiting there in his elvis costum holding a sizemore sign..Boy was @PERSON2 a goof.  @PERSON1 was just telling me all these things, and @CAPS6 was then that i relized @PERSON1 had tought me something else @CAPS8 appreciate. @PERSON1 had taught me how @CAPS8 appreciate laughter at a time @CAPS4 sorrow. @CAPS8 rejoice in a time of dealth, @CAPS8 have hope when you felt like you had none left. I learned that even tho people might not think so, laughter is the key medicine @CAPS8 everyones pain. People don't think of laughter as a cure they think of @CAPS6 as something you do after you hear a joke. Laughter is so much more then people give @CAPS6 credit for. My @PERSON1 taught me all those things, plus the real meaning of laughter, and that will always be @CAPS4 me.
