                                Outdoor @CAPS1 In sixth grade I went to outdoor @CAPS1 I got up really early and went to @CAPS1 where the bus is taking students to outdoor @CAPS1. First, of all I board on the way to outdoor @CAPS1. Then they told us in which cabin we were suppose to be I had seven cabin members including myself. I brought my electronic device but the teachers told us that we couldn't bring no devices to the trip. The next day we did some activities first we ate lunch before doing any activities. The foods that we ate were pizza, pizza pockets, and hot dogs then the activities that we did were catch some fishes and put them back to the water we were just examine them the other activities that we did was hike the mountains on the way we saw deers they were eating grass I got really tired then when we came back we were getting ready to go home. Finally I would want to help out and I really enjoyed my field trip.
