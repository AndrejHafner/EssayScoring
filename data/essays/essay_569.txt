 Laughter plays an important role in everyone's lives. Different laughs represent various things. For instance, have @CAPS2 ever heard someone chuckle and know right away that they are being sarcastic, or maybe even sympathetic? A laugh can say a lot. I'm going to tell @CAPS2 about the time my friend fell into an @NUM1 pond.  In early @DATE1, my friend was visiting me at my house for a week. The third morning of her stay, we woke up and it had snowed seven inches @TIME1. I was used to the soft, white flakes spiraling through the air, @CAPS1 @CAPS1 was from @LOCATION1 and had never seen snow before. As my friend was listing all of the things @CAPS1 wanted to do that day, @CAPS1 let out the most anxious laugh I had ever heard. I could tell @CAPS1 just wanted to go outside that very moment. Of course @CAPS1 knew it was going to be cold but I didn't think @CAPS1 knew how cold. I told her it was going to be chillier than what @CAPS1 might be expecting.  We got dressed in numerous layers of clothing: socks, pants, shirts, and jackets so we could head out. As we were walking down the snowy hill @CAPS1 spotted the @NUM1 pond on the lower half of my property and hurled towards it. @CAPS1 asked if we could go swimming, I laughed a sarcastic laugh and answered, "heck no!" @CAPS1 walked toward a massive log that lays across the water and decided to cross it. @CAPS1 said that if I didn't go with her @CAPS1 would push me in. So I took a step back, @CAPS1 just looked down and continued walking. As @CAPS1 stepped onto the log that was glazed with ice @CAPS1 got a little cocky and decided to jump around to show me it was "fun." I laughed at the funny movements @CAPS1 was making and whispered, "@CAPS2're going to fall." All of a sudden @CAPS1 slipped and the ice cracked. It reminded me of glass shattering on a cement floor. This picture in front of me was almost as if it was in slow motion; I can remember her hands reaching up to grasp the log before @CAPS1 fell in to the freezing water. @CAPS1 fell through, I bounded @TIME1 to help her out, I slowly pulled her out of the pond. I looked at her after I had harpooned onto the log and we both burst out in laughter...although her teeth were chattering and her multiple layers of clothing we soaked, I knew @CAPS1 was @CAPS3 going to cherish this moment because it was her first snow experience.  Walking up to the house @CAPS1 giggled, "I should have listened to @CAPS2 huh?" I nodded my head and suggested we take off her clothes to ring out and put in the dryer.We changed into pajamas and sipped on hot chocolate and coffee all day long, sharing laughter and smiles. I will @CAPS3 remember this day because there were so many different stories I can tell from it.
