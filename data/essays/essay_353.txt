 "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." I think that laughter is really important in any part, in any kind of relationship. When people laugh, @CAPS2 get to understand each other better, @CAPS6 usually people think that you are a cool person when you say something funny, @CAPS6 laugh with them when @CAPS2 say funny stuff. It's funner with people who are laughing with you or make you laugh. There were many times throughout my life when many problems were solved by just telling a joke, saying something funny or even remembering fun memories from the past. I have many @CAPS4 that I love, but of course like in any other friendship, we've had little fights between us.  I remember one time when my @CAPS4 @CAPS6 I went to hang out at the mall. Two of my @CAPS4 came into a huge conflict because of something really weird, which later became an argument. Of course we always had little conflicts, but @CAPS7 time I guess the two girls were serious @CAPS6 mad at each other! My other friend @PERSON1 @CAPS6 I were looking at them @CAPS6 didn't know what to do. @CAPS6 my friend @PERSON1 was kind of scared that @CAPS2 might hurt each other. I told them," @CAPS1 you guys! Don't be like that!" @CAPS2 looked at me @CAPS6 stopped. So we started to walk. @CAPS6 I remembered something funny @CAPS6 crazy that those two girls @CAPS6 us did, at a camp the week before @CAPS7 happened, @CAPS6 after that camp I remember how @CAPS2 were saying how we are going to be "@CAPS3 @CAPS4 For @CAPS5" for our whole life's @CAPS6 that @CAPS2 wouldn't forget how much fun we had. I started to laugh remembering what we did that camp, @CAPS6 @CAPS2 looked at me like I'm weird or something. So I reminded them about all that fun stuff we did, @CAPS6 @CAPS2 looked at each other @CAPS6 started to laugh really hard! Because their conflict had something little to do with that camp, what @CAPS2've had forgotten!  After that @CAPS2 started to talk to each other @CAPS6 forgot about that conflict that @CAPS2 had. Sometimes I remind them about the conflict, but @CAPS2 just laugh @CAPS6 say "We were so dumb, to make that conflict!" @CAPS6 we all laugh at them."Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." @CAPS7 is why I think that laughter is really imported in any friendship. @CAPS6 I think that @CAPS7 problem was solved by just saying some funny memories so @CAPS2 can laugh! @CAPS6 reminding someone a thing that @CAPS2 had forgotten.
