The time i went @CAPS1-wheeling!One time when i went @CAPS1-wheeling with @PERSON3, @PERSON5, @PERSON1, @PERSON4 and i we went up @ORGANIZATION1. This is the arrangements of who was in what trucks. It was @PERSON2 and I in my @CAPS2 @NUM1, @PERSON1 and @PERSON4 in his tracker @NUM1, and @PERSON3 and @PERSON5 in his @NUM3 wheel drive jeep @CAPS3. When we started to head back down the mountain @PERSON3 let @PERSON5 drive down. @PERSON5 can't see very well at night because she wears glasses and her eye sights not very good. Well i was following them down the mountain and we finally got to the pavement and @PERSON5 was going pretty fast for that road because its a narrow curving road and that was the first time she had ever been on it before. She went to go around a really sharp corner and got up on two wheels and flipped over right in front of me so i had to slam on the brakes so that i wouldn't run into them. So i shut my truck off run over there as fast as i could and helped @PERSON5 out of the truck and when i turn back around to go help @PERSON3 out hes already on top of the truck.He looks at @PERSON5 ans says "@CAPS4 look at what you did to my truck, i have tried many of times to roll it and never have been able to god damn you!". So we all started laughing and then i got a chain out of the back of my truck and pulled him back over. Then it was really quite and @PERSON4 farted and we all started to laugh again. Well then @PERSON3 found out that he got a hole in his radiator i had to pull him back to his house and it seemed like the longest drive ever because his truck weighs way more than mine so i had to pull him home in @CAPS1 wheel drive and you cant go over thirty in @CAPS1 wheel drive because stuff can break. So we finally get to his house and his dad comes out side and he saw the truck and was really pissed because he gave that truck to him for a graduation present and he messed it all up. Then he finally cooled of cause he said no one was hurt and he was glad for that so we went in the house and ate dinner and went to bed. So the moral of the story is be very careful because things can happen when they are unexpected.
