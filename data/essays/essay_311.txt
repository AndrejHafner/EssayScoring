 We were all ging out in to the woods to go ride quads and trikes, @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 had quads I was the only on with the trike. We loaded the trike and quads in the back of the truck and trailer and was off to the woods. We get out their and uloaded our rides, we get all of them warmed up but the one with a clutch. the only way to get that one started is to pull it with the automatic quadWilber says to @PERSON1 that he will get it started so u pull me. I get up their and hook the rope on to aech quad @PERSON1 says hes ready,so @PERSON1 is taking off fast and some how the hook just comes off and hits him prfectly on his back he gets up and it looks like hes dancing. He lifted up his shirt and asked s if there was any mark, oh man was there the hook hit him perfectly, it looked judt like a hook wa printd on his back.             @PERSON1 starts to taer up a liitle bit while holding his back. i didnt blame him i would of to, u could hear it snap when it hit him. I look over at @PERSON1 and hes trying not to laugh, @PERSON1 looks over at @PERSON1 and gets off the quad and started to chase him. I finally got there attention and said,"we came out here to ride not to kick some ass." we finally get the bike going but @PERSON1 was to scared to pull the quad so i had to do it, as soon as we get the quad with the clutch to warm up, a cop car comes down by us then turns his lights on. We new what we were going to have to do so as soon as i see @PERSON1 take off i took off. @PERSON1 and I look back to see if @PERSON1 was behind us and no he was not.             @PERSON1 told me we should just leave him ,but i told him that would be way to mest up we come back and the cop told us he was suprized that we came back. we asked @PERSON1 what happend and he didnt know after dealing with the cops for the day, we tried to figure out what was rong with the bike and we found out some one was messing with the carbrator and they were totally off.             it sucked we dont get our licences tikll we eighteen ,but for @PERSON1 its twenty one, that really sucks for him. After that one day @PERSON1 promised that he would never go with @PERSON1 and I again.
