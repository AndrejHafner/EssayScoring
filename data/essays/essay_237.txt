 @CAPS4 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 you ever felt like there just wasent enugh time in the day to do everything you would like to do.@CAPS7 that's how i feel every day,@CAPS4 @CAPS2 i find it very tireing and screwed up,and it all started when i got @CAPS4 job at the @ORGANIZATION1.Ever sinc i got the job i never @CAPS3 an time for school,@CAPS5,and can hardly get any rest.@CAPS4 greads @CAPS3 been dropping little by little.@CAPS10 always tired falling asleep in classes or just to lazy to do @CAPS4 work,I would cut down on @CAPS4 hours but i need as much money as i can get to help @CAPS4 mom out as much as i can.@CAPS4 mom didn't really do much with her @CAPS2 so now she has nothing really to live off of .So i feel that i @CAPS3 to help her out as much as i can,@CAPS4 older brother would @CAPS3 hade this responsibility but he got hes girlfriend pragnet and moved out to live hes own @CAPS2 at an early age.So by me being the second oldest i find it @CAPS4 responsibility to take care of @CAPS4 mom.      I love @CAPS4 mom very much and she has been there all @CAPS4 @CAPS2,unlike @CAPS4 dad...so ill do as much as i can to see to it that she stays wealthy.Becuse when shes gone @CAPS10 not sure what i would do without her. @CAPS4 little brother is a pain in @CAPS4 back he never dose anything to help aroud the house or like help @CAPS4 mom out when she breings home grossuries or anything like that,so i think that @CAPS10 going to @CAPS3 to set him streath.I know mom wont like it but "All @CAPS7"he needs to stop being so lazy and help our mom more. Now back to me @CAPS10 a pertty good kid i think anyways,@CAPS7 @CAPS10 a trubel maker dont get me wrong but if i did the right things i could be a secssful kid.I try to be that kid some times but it's just so boring and i just cant do it becuse when i try i feel like @CAPS10 tryung to be a hole different person,@CAPS9 just not me @CAPS10 a loud and hiper kid that is the class clown in the class rooms.Like pepole are always asking me if i @CAPS3 any plans for galleage and all i ever say is that i dont think that @CAPS10 calleage smart and that ill be lucky if i graduate.@CAPS10 trying to bring @CAPS4 grades back up but @CAPS9 hard when you @CAPS3 so much othere stuff to do out of school,like @CAPS4 job and now seens winter is about over spring is on it's way,that means work is going to get alot busyer and i am going to @CAPS3 to work alot more.To tell you the truth @CAPS10 not sure if or how @CAPS10 going to do it all. With all of this responsibility i am going to be one tired teen age boy,@CAPS10 pertty sure that i can handl it if i really try @CAPS4 best.All i know is that i need to find a better job thats less stressful,tireing and less days to work but get payed better money.Like at jiffy lube of someting anyting is better then working at a fast foods place.
