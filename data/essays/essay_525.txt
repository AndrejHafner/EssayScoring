                                 Love in @LOCATION1 was a small boy, who didn't have very much ambition in life, he was taunted and teased to the point where he would just hide away in his house and not talk to anyone. The other boys at school would laugh at @ORGANIZATION1 for being so much smaller than themselves. He was never the fastest, strongest, or coolest but he was the smartest. He knew how to twist and turn any phrase to make himself feel superior to others. @ORGANIZATION1 was in truth lonely, he had never laughed or felt the cool touch of a lover. He wished dearly that he could be more outgoing to the point where a girl would fall in love with him. There was in fact a girl he had his eye on for months, her name was @PERSON1. She was the most beautiful girl he had have laid eyes on. He had followed her all over town, and rode his bicycle past her almost everyday when she was with her friend @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1 hated @CAPS1 for he had gotten to be with @PERSON1 everyday, and got to hold her and talk to her. @ORGANIZATION1 had envied @CAPS1 for around four months before he had messaged her on a website called "myyeabook" a place to meet new people and make friends. @ORGANIZATION1 had sent her a friend request and asked for her digits. Hoping she would find him attractive and let him text her. @PERSON1 accepted his request and sent him a message saying "@CAPS4 I see your from the town next to mine, we should hang out sometime it would be cool." @ORGANIZATION1 had almost lost it when he had read this, he went and got a hair cut, and new clothes just so that she would think he was attractive and cool. @PERSON1 had went to the park with her friend @PERSON2 and waited for this fellow named @ORGANIZATION1. She and @PERSON2 had played on the swings, and spun each other on the spinning wheel. @ORGANIZATION1 had been riding his bike and set it down a hundred yards away from where they were. He walked over said "@CAPS4." to @PERSON2 and proceeded to walk over to @LOCATION2. He told her he thought she was beautiful and had an amazing smile. @PERSON1 blushed and asked him if he wanted to swing for a while. @PERSON2 took off home, seeing that @PERSON1 was going to be okay with this guy, and little did they know, they were made for each other. @ORGANIZATION1 let his guard down and told her some jokes, he laid out his life story almost with her, he was so comfortable around her and he didn't know why. @PERSON1 felt the same way, she laughed at his jokes, and told him her life story. In this one short meeting they had connected on a level that was far from their ages. @ORGANIZATION1 found out that @PERSON1 was smart, and loved to be outdoors, she was practically the female version of himself. After a month of conversation and hanging out off and on, @ORGANIZATION1 sent @PERSON1 a text message saying "@CAPS6 you down to be my partner in life?" @PERSON1 was stunned and excited that @ORGANIZATION1 wanted her to be his girlfriend. @PERSON1 simply replied "@CAPS6 you down to be mine?" @ORGANIZATION1 replied back to her "I love you." @PERSON1 was the happiest girl in the world that night of @DATE1, @NUM1 @DATE2. The two went everywhere together and did everything together, everyone knew that they were perfect for each other. @PERSON1 began to fall in love with @ORGANIZATION1 and after four months of being together told him finally. @ORGANIZATION1 was so elated that he went out and bought her a ring, and she graciously accepted it. @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 moved in together and started a family. A little laughter can go a long way, in anything you do, a job, a family, or even in the hopes of finding your perfect someone. @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 found that their love had come from that day many months ago in that park, laughing about even the smallest of things such as a corny joke, or an adventure of another can lead the way to a lifetime of true love. All it takes is a little bit of laughter.
