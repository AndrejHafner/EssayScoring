 It was a day like any other. I was going to chess club to challenge the board one holder. I had never piercingly met him for I was new to the club, but I knew that if I didn't play @CAPS7 best I would lose. I entered the room hoping to see that the holder was not there, @CAPS2 was. @CAPS2 had on a blue baseball cap, a blue t-shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and a pair of black shoes. His hair was as dark as his shoes and looked as if @CAPS2 had not brushed it in years, his skin was very pale I wondered how @CAPS2 could go out in sun with out some way to block it. The board was set up and ready, @CAPS1 was the clock. the clock had an hour on each side. I walked up to him, @CAPS2 didn't even seem to notice me until I spoke, "@CAPS1 @CAPS12 guna beat me fast. I know I'm guna lose." @CAPS2 just sat there, staring at me like I had insulted him. "@CAPS1," @CAPS2 scoffed, "your the kid they think can beat me." "I guess. I never really thought about it." I was unsure as to why that would mater, but I was playing him, @CAPS1 I was absolutely sure that it was or was going to mater very soon. "@CAPS4 please take @CAPS12 seat @CAPS1 we can begin the matches!" the coach called out, "@CAPS5, we all know the rules, the black player @MONTH1 start the white @CAPS4 clocks. No talking." "@CAPS1." I said, "your name is what." "@CAPS7 name is @CAPS8." I hit the clock. Expecting him to be like lightning and move, I moved @CAPS7 piece. Bad move. @CAPS2 called and pointed out that I had moved a piece when it was not @CAPS7 turn. The coach came up to the clock and pressed some buttons, @CAPS2 didn't even look like @CAPS2 cared about the game and if a board ten holder could beat a board one holder. When @CAPS2 set the clock down the clock showed fifty to fifty five. I was already down on time and the game hadn't even really began.  @CAPS8 picked up the kings bishops pawn and moved it up one square. @CAPS2 hit the clock like lightning. That was wired @CAPS2 moved the weakest piece on the board. I had to stop and think for a vary long time or what felt like it. I looked over at the clock to see how I was doing on time. It was terrible I had been sitting there for about ten minutes and I hadn't even moved one lousy piece. @CAPS1 I picked up @CAPS7 king's pawn and moved up two squares hopping @CAPS2 wouldn't do anything that could hurt @CAPS7 in @CAPS13 game. I hit @CAPS7 clock.  We sat there for what must have been half an hour. @CAPS1 I got up and went to the bathroom. When I came back I checked on how the other @CAPS4 were doing. Only one game was done it was @PERSON1 and a kid I didn't know. I asked who won, it was the kid I didn't know as odd as that was I had to get back to @CAPS7 game.   @CAPS2 still hadn't moved, for a minute I thought @CAPS2 was having a problem breathing. @CAPS2 let out a yawn and moved his king's knight's pawn up two squares and hit the clock. That was weird, @CAPS2 just did fools @CAPS10. I didn't think for a minute, I piked up @CAPS7 queen and brought it all the way to one square in front of his rook pawn. I said "@CAPS9 @CAPS10." in a loud voice.  @CAPS2 started to laugh, at first I was confused for I beat him.Then @CAPS2 said,"I do @CAPS13 with every one I play for the first time, @CAPS13 opening."@CAPS2 started to laugh again, @CAPS13 time I joined him we both were laughing because I beat him. Then @CAPS2 said, "@CAPS12 are the first one to see that they could win in the first two." That surprised me I thought that @CAPS2 won all the time when really @CAPS2 had been giving people games and the didn't know it. We started to laugh again, the coach came over and saw that I won @CAPS2 said good job and walked away. @CAPS8 said, "@CAPS13 is the start of a new beginning I can quit board one now for there is someone who can beat me." @CAPS2 walked up to the coach and must have told him that @CAPS2 wanted me on board one for now I'm on board one and @CAPS7 new friend, @CAPS8 is there with me on board two.
