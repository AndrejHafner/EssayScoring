Laughter is the best medicine Many people say laughter is the best medicine. I for one, agree. The reason why is that in many points of @CAPS27 life, laughter has helped me, or others, feel a whole lot better. @CAPS27 mother recently got surgery on her shoulder. @CAPS4 had medicine @CAPS2 all @CAPS34 I think the best @CAPS4 took was three nights ago when I was with her in her room...Doing a word-search.  It was @DATE1 @TIME1. Every @DATE1 @CAPS27 step dad's kids come over for dinner. @CAPS27 mom wasn't really feeling well so @CAPS4 went upstairs @CAPS2 started on her big book of word-searches. @CAPS27 step-sister had recently gotten a new car so @CAPS4 @CAPS2 @CAPS27 step-dad were outside looking at it. I went out for @CAPS19 two minutes then came back inside. @CAPS27 step-brother was on @CAPS27 step-dad's iPad. He showed me this game on @CAPS22 @CAPS2 we started playing. A few minutes later @PERSON2, @CAPS27 step dad, said that he was going to @ORGANIZATION1. Katie, @CAPS27 step-sister, @CAPS2 @PERSON1, @CAPS27 step-brother, decided to @CAPS46 with them. @PERSON2 went upstairs to ask @CAPS27 mom if @CAPS4 needed anything. Then they left @CAPS2 I went upstairs to check on her. I saw @CAPS4 was going her word-search @CAPS2 I started to help her.  I don't remember the name of the word-search @CAPS34 we did several. Since @CAPS4 had already started I was looking over the letters, looking for another word. Apparently I wasn't looking close enough because I swore I saw a word that wasn't even in the puzzle. So I said it @CAPS2 @CAPS27 mom said, "@CAPS1 me?" @CAPS2 I started laughing. I repeated myself @CAPS2 we were both laughing. After that wore off we finished the word-search @CAPS2 started a new one. This one was called "@CAPS3." @CAPS4 took the book @CAPS2 looked over the list @CAPS2 suddenly said "@CAPS5-winks! Yeah!" @CAPS2 I looked at her like @CAPS4 was crazy. Which @CAPS4 was. I looked at the list again @CAPS2 I start laughing really hard @CAPS2 ask, "@CAPS7's @CAPS8?" I was saying it wrong @CAPS34 when @CAPS24 were laughing that hard, who wouldn't?  "@CAPS7?" @CAPS4 asked @CAPS2 I showed it to her. "@CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13." @CAPS4 said @CAPS2 we started laughing. "That sounds like something the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 would say." I comment @CAPS2 @CAPS27 mom does the little song from the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 song which made me laugh harder. We barely made it through the end of the word-search. @CAPS34 we did. The next one I think was called "@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21" @CAPS22 were several things on @CAPS22 we didn't know. I asked her @CAPS7 one was @CAPS2 @CAPS4's like, "I don't know." @CAPS2 then I asked her another. "@CAPS24're asking me all the things I don't know." @CAPS4 said. This word search was kind of funny @CAPS34 only because we were saying the rest of the letters after the actual word which made them pretty funny. I accidentally circled the word "ear" because I thought it was on the list. It wasn't. @CAPS34 "earring" was. We ended up finding "hair" at the end of the "ear" I'd circled. "@CAPS26 thanks for that picture." @CAPS27 mom said. "@CAPS7? Ear-hair?" I asked @CAPS2 we laughed again. When we finished that we went onto "@CAPS29". That was a funny word-search. We usually read over the list of words before we look for them. One of the words was "@CAPS30" @CAPS2 I laughed @CAPS2 said "@CAPS26 yeah, I can see someone walking around with a @CAPS30 on their head. '@CAPS32, nice @CAPS30.'" I said in a weird voice. "'@CAPS26 thanks. I got it from the @CAPS30 store.'" I guess I was doing a pretty good job because @CAPS27 mom was laughing really really hard.  "@CAPS34 wouldn't that be uncomfortable? I mean it's a @CAPS30. I'd think the tail would always be slapping the back of @CAPS20 head." I said before laughing again. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 walked in the room @CAPS2 looked at us like '@CAPS7 the heck?' @CAPS2 I showed her the word-search. "@CAPS26, it's not a cowboy hat. It's the full cowboy." @CAPS4 said, laughing as well. @CAPS27 mom shook her head, trying to say something. "@CAPS39, @CAPS39, it's things that wear hats." @CAPS4 managed to get out @CAPS2 I'm looking at her. "@CAPS7 kind of a hat does a @CAPS30 wear?" I asked, smirking. @CAPS4 shook her head. "I don't know." @CAPS4 said like @CAPS4 was giving up. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 then said good-bye @CAPS2 left. "@CAPS43, @CAPS39 more. I need to take @CAPS27 pills." I snorted at @CAPS7 @CAPS4 said. "@CAPS39, @CAPS24 really don't need any pills." @CAPS4 looks at me like @CAPS4 was going to punch me. @CAPS4 might have if I wasn't standing a few feet away. "@CAPS46 away." @CAPS4 said with a smile. "@CAPS48." I said before turning @CAPS2 walking back to @CAPS27 room. I've had several things like this happen. All of them were really funny. They were the humor that @CAPS24 kind of had to be @CAPS22 to understand. I still said laughter is the best medicine. Mom says its @CAPS49.
