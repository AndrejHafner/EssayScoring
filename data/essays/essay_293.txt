 Have you ever been in an an awkward situation and lightened the mood with laughter? I have, as have many. I find that laughter makes people more comfortable, which allows them to be their own person. Laughter @MONTH1 even help some to attract a positive, friendly crowd, who enjoy funny, happy people. Laughter @MONTH1 not work in this way for everyone, but here are some ways it has helped me. I was at a homeschoolers' group in @LOCATION1 years ago and didn't know anyone there. After walking around a while this girl talked to me. She was funny, and being able to laugh made me more comfortable and I had a fun time. I just had to fin d the right person. Another time where laughter might've helped was when I was invited to a birthday party of a friend I hadn't seen in over two years. Several others were there I hadn't seen in a long while. The whole visit was awkward and all I wanted to do was blend in. I acted like everyone else, but if I'd had laughed and been more comfortable I would've been my own person. When I first came to public school I was nervous to meet new people, and what kind of people there would be. After a week or so people got to see my personality, the funny, happy, laughable person inside, and that clicked with a lot of people. That's why I'm friends with the people I'm friends with now, because our alike personalities matched. Laughter brought me to a good place in life. Laughter can make a lot of people happy and comfortable in awkward situations. It can encourage people to show their own personality and attract people like themselves. I think the world would be a happier place if everyone could laugh.
