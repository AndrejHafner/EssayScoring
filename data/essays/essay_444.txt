 Laughter is a part of my life. When I laugh, I always have this feeling of happiness and a connection with others. Laughter makes any relationship stronger. I remember when I was sad, I would go and talk to my friend @PERSON2. I went to him because we could talk about why I was feeling that way. Then after a while we would be laughing - being happy. Laughter brought me closer to my friend. We were able to understand each other. We have been friends since we were in elementary. Because of laughter in our relationship and memories of days when we laughed, it has made this relationship last. I have been mad at my friend and he has been mad at me. But because of all those good times we have had laughing . We are still great friends.Here is a time when laughter was in one of my friend relationships. @PERSON2, @PERSON1 and I were at @ORGANIZATION1's house. It was a @DATE1. We were listening to music and talking about stuff. We didn't do much that day. Except the thing that they were about to do. Out of nowhere @PERSON2's little nephew starts dancing and laughing while doing it. @PERSON1 gets up and does the same. @PERSON2 then gets up too- it was something I didn't expect to happen. They chose a certain song and made a dance for it. The whole time this was happening we were all having a good time. They all looked funny doing their dance. After a while @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 got tired. But we kept on laughing because @PERSON2's nephew kept on dancing. They danced to this song a few other times that @DATE1. It was still funny to me the last time as it was the first time they did it. Laughter connected my friendship many other times. This one though, is the one I mostly remember because it was funny. I remember it like if it was just last week. Being happy in a relationship makes it last a long time. That is why I think laughter is important and it does really make any relationship stronger. I have this story to prove it.
