 A time when laughter was one element or part was when my brother showed a youtube video to my family. The video was about a guy who was talking about his childhood when his dad told him to go to the store to get bread to make sandwiches for dinner and was told to not to get into any trouble. To avoid getting into trouble his dad told him to go across the street because there was three boys down the block that looked like trouble. So he did what his dad told him to do and he went across the street but when he was passing the boys they stopped him. One of the boys yelled out something and a bunch of their friends came flying from a that was barbershop across the street and surrounded him. He managed to get free and ran as fast as he could. He said that he was running so fast that he knew that he passed a @ORGANIZATION1 because he said he was behind it and then was in front of the car running to get to his house. When he got to his house he told his dad that he did what he told. The dad was only worried about is if he got the bread and the guy was upset that his dad was worried about bread instead of him. The way the guy told his childhood memory was funny and even though I was already shown the video by brother the night before we both still thought it was funny and so did my family and we would burst out laughing at times.
