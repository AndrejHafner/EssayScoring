 The human brain is a piece of work. Its the kingdom to our lives. It infuriates us, guides us, helps us and destroys us. Our brains can make our bodies feel anything it wants to. Its really something else. One of the most valuable things are brains are capable of is a sense of humor. Laughter. The ability to not take life to seriously for a moment. That light switch in @CAPS7 body that causes @CAPS7 brain to reach a state of uncontrollable happiness. Laughter is our brains only way of coping with the world. Scoping out the comical events life has to offer us. I am personally one of those people that finds everything in life funny, or will find a way to make it funny. I am hardly ever serious nor take things seriously. The same with my friends, we are always the people having a good time because we make life interesting. Maybe its our gnarly facial expressions we exchange one another, or we @MONTH1 just be funny looking. Either way we have a sense of humor. That's @CAPS4 life is about, @CAPS1 @CAPS7 happiness with people who fill @CAPS7 life with joy. @PERSON1 said, "live simply, so that others can simply live." I @CAPS9 we all can with a little sense of humor. Last year a couple friends and I went to mission ridge for a weekend to go snowboarding. We had it made, our own hotel suite with two king sized beds and a plasma @CAPS2. @PERSON2 and I slept on one bed and @PERSON3 on the other. We all have always gotten along perfectly and have shared the biggest laughs together. Nothing could come between any of us. Other than a little midnight prank. On the second night at the hotel, @PERSON3 fell asleep first. @PERSON2 and I were watching some ghost movie that bored us to tears. @PERSON2 was eating a bag of pop corn and started throwing little kettle pieces at @LOCATION1, trying to wake him up. "@CAPS3, I have the funniest idea." @PERSON2 whispered over to me. "@CAPS4?" I mouthed back lazily. Without a word @PERSON2 jumped out of bed and ran into the bathroom. She returned with a tube of @ORGANIZATION2 tooth paste, a sack of coins and a package of peach rings. "I had nothing to do with this." I stated, continuing to glare at the television set. @PERSON2 began squirting out tooth paste onto @PERSON3's arms, she ran the creamy solution down his legs, back up to his face and into his hair. She stuck quarters, dimes, and penny's into the minty cement, along with the sugary peach rings. "@CAPS5 is going to kill you." I gasped. "@CAPS6 @CAPS5 wont! It will be hilarious." @PERSON2 blurted and then plopped back onto the hotel bed, admiring her work. @PERSON2 then picked up her bag of popcorn and resumed throwing pieces of kettle at @LOCATION1's face. The next morning was not how @PERSON2 planned. @PERSON3 woke up alright, but did not have the expression on his face @PERSON2 intended on. "@CAPS7 done for @PERSON2!" @PERSON3 hollered. @PERSON2 smiled, still convinced this was all a joke. I saw the fury in @LOCATION1's eyes. @CAPS5 was beyond irate. His body crusted over with dried tooth paste. Quarters, dimes and penny's drilled into his skin and peach rings dangled moldy off his legs. @PERSON3 rushed into the bathroom to look into the mirror. @CAPS5 stormed back into the room with a shampoo bottle clenched in his hand. @PERSON2 turned to face him and her smile disintegrated. "@CAPS4 are you gonna do with that shampoo bottle?" @PERSON2 questioned, confused. @PERSON3 grew closer to @PERSON2, she backed away slowly, not quite sure @CAPS4 his intentions were. They both switched positions, her back now facing the door and @PERSON3 across the room by the window. @PERSON3 raised the shampoo bottle over his head. "@CAPS9 fast." @PERSON3 shouted and chucked the bottle as hard as @CAPS5 could at @ORGANIZATION1's face. But sadly, @PERSON2 ducked just in time for the bottle to miss her face and create a nuclear explosion on the door behind her. Blue liquid spewed out all over the walls. There was an indent of where the bottle hit the door. @PERSON2's whole back side was covered in blue sludge. I hopped out of bed and ran to the entrance where the explosion took place. @PERSON3 reached @PERSON2 and immediately burst into roaring laughter. @PERSON2 sat down in a puddle of shampoo and ruptured in chuckles. I stood there, smiling at them. @PERSON3 still crusted over, @PERSON2 covered in blue goop that looked like someone threw up a blueberry smoothie on her back. I sat down with them, we all starred at each other without a word. everything was fine. It then occurred to me that @CAPS6 matter @CAPS4 we do to each other, enrage or try to explode one another, we will always find a way to laugh about it. A sense of humor is merely our souls telling us everything will be okay. Its that one value in life we can cherish forever.
