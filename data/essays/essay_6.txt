@CAPS3 I'm going to tell @CAPS18 a little story. I remember a time when @CAPS11 cousin @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I decided to make a snowman at @CAPS11 house in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. I say to him, I'm bored, @CAPS1 do @CAPS18 want to do?" @PERSON1 replies,"@CAPS2 go make a snowman." @CAPS3 I agree that that would be fun. @CAPS34 starts reaching for a jacket @CAPS3 gloves, but I stop him @CAPS3 say," @CAPS1 are @CAPS18 getting those for?" "@CAPS5's not cold @CAPS20." "@CAPS6," replies @PERSON1. "@CAPS33't say I didn't warn @CAPS18."   We start our snowman by building the base (The biggest piece for the bottom). @CAPS3 after about @NUM1 minutes the base is almost done, but we notice that we're getting cold. "@CAPS7 we should go inside?" @PERSON1 says. "@CAPS8, I @CAPS7 mom will even make us some hot chocolate." @CAPS9 off we go back inside hoping for some delectably warm hot chocolate. I see @CAPS11 mom @CAPS3 ask, "@CAPS10 we have some hot chocolate please?" "@CAPS11 @CAPS18 look cold, Of course I'll make @CAPS18 some." @CAPS9 @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I sit downstairs waiting anxiously for our hot chocolate by the heater to get warm.   "@CAPS5's ready!" @CAPS11 mom calls from upstairs. We fly down the hall @CAPS3 rush up the stairs. @CAPS3 to our amazement we find not only hot chocolate but a bag of chips as @CAPS28. "@CAPS14 mom!"I say. "@CAPS14 @CAPS16 @CAPS17!"says @PERSON1. "@CAPS18're welcome boys"says @CAPS11 mom. @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I sit down at the table @CAPS3 start drinking our hot chocolate, while @CAPS11 mom puts some chips on paper towels for us. I start eating the chips by the handfuls whereas @PERSON1 grabs one, just one. I ask him," @CAPS19 did @CAPS18 only grab one @PERSON1?" @CAPS20 of the corner of his eye @CAPS34 looks at me @CAPS3 slowly brings the chip to his mouth @CAPS3 takes a bite. As @CAPS34 did that I fell @CAPS20 of @CAPS11 chair in a fit of hysterical laughter.    @CAPS11 mom hears the thump of me hitting the floor @CAPS3 runs upstairs to find me laughing. "@CAPS1's @CAPS9 funny?" she asks. I say to @PERSON1, "@CAPS22 her." @PERSON1 then complies @CAPS3 grabs another chip @CAPS3 while @CAPS34 looks at her from the corner of his eye, slowly brings @CAPS5 to his mouth @CAPS3 takes a bite. I start busting up laughing again, yet @CAPS11 mom doesn't see the humor. She simply asks," @CAPS23 is that @CAPS9 funny?" @PERSON1 replies," I have no idea but @CAPS34 just about died from laughter. I start to stop laughing @CAPS3 I'm able to stand up again. I then tell @CAPS11 mom," @CAPS5's the way @CAPS34 looks at @CAPS18, @CAPS5 just makes @CAPS18 laugh."   I then @CAPS35 to do the same thing, but with no effect to @PERSON1. "@CAPS19 isn't @CAPS5 working?" I ask. "@CAPS26 I'm awesome like that @CAPS3 @CAPS18're @NUM2 says. "@CAPS6, @CAPS28 I'm gonna keep at @CAPS5 until I get @CAPS5 right." @CAPS9 I @CAPS35 to mimic everything I saw him do, but to no avail. All I made happen was I spilled @CAPS11 hot chocolate all over myself, which made him laugh, albeit not the way I wanted to. "@CAPS18 want me to @CAPS22 @CAPS18?" @PERSON1 says. "@CAPS31!!!! Please!" I beg. "@CAPS6, @CAPS33't say I didn't warn @CAPS18." @CAPS34 proceeds then to grab another chip @CAPS3 while looking at me from the corner of his eye, bites the chip. I start laughing uncontrollably then @CAPS3 without pause. After about @NUM1 minutes I stop laughing.   "I'll get that right!" I say. @PERSON1 says,"@CAPS35 @CAPS5." I grab a chip @CAPS3 look straight at him @CAPS3 bite down, nothing. I @CAPS35 again, this time while looking at him from the corner of @CAPS11 eye, nothing yet again. I @CAPS7 to myself, "@CAPS36 I @CAPS33't get @CAPS5 this time I'm giving up." "@CAPS6, here goes." I grab a chip @CAPS3 slowly bring @CAPS5 to @CAPS11 mouth while squinting at him from the corner of @CAPS11 eye. I bite the chip. I notice @CAPS34's laughing. @CAPS34's laughing!!! "I told @CAPS18 I'd get @CAPS5!" " @CAPS31, @CAPS31 @CAPS18 did." @CAPS3 this is one of the many times laughter brought @CAPS11 cousin @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I together."
