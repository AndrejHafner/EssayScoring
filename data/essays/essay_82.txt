 LaughterI laugh everyday. I feel a lot of different emotions when I am laughing. Some of the emotions are happiness, sadness, and pain. I use laughter to let my emotions be seen. when I laugh I usually feel happy after wards en less I am crying because I am hurt. When I am sad I tend to laugh and smile a lot to hide the pain I am feeling because I don't want people to see me sad all the time and think I am playing the sad card to get attention. But laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better. When I am sad i tend to rely on laughter to get me threw my day because if i didn't have laughter i would have people asking what was wrong all day and it would drive me crazy. When I am angry the only way I can laugh is if a friends or family member is trying to make me happy or if I am reminiscing of fun times iv had. It makes me happy when I laugh and brightens my day when I am anger. I also laugh at things people say to me even tho they hurt my feelings when they said it, because I don't want them to know they hurt me. When I am happy all I do is smile and laugh. Laughter brightens my life when its a happy laugh.My friends and I can just sit there and laugh for hours and nothing. My friends and I can be pretty silly at times and all we can do is laugh, have fun and be in a good mood, and that makes me pretty happy. Some things in my life that make me laugh are my nephew my family and friends. All those things I was just talking about come into my mind when I think of laughter. I think that every single person needs some laughter in there life to be happy.
