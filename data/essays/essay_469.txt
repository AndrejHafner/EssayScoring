  It all started at the play ground @CAPS9 me my friend @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 were just sitting around and we saw these two girls walk up and it was these girls from school @PERSON1 and @CAPS1. We didn't know who it was at first so we sat back all cool like tell i noticed it was them @CAPS9 they got closer. They ran up and said "hey guys want to go on a adventure to the woods" "sure why not" we all said "we ain't got nothing better to do so we walked which seemed like @NUM1 miles @CAPS9 it was only @NUM2 feet from the play ground it felt like a long way either way i was lazy at the time.  @CAPS9 we got into the @CAPS2 it had a lot of bushes and trees that we thought we could make a fort out of bushes and chill and eat donuts from @ORGANIZATION1 there but what we didn't know was there was something living in that @CAPS2 that we were not aware of. Turns out we went into the wrong @CAPS2 and there was a lot of animals in the place we went into. So as i was sitting on the long by the creek i saw a brownish figure walk by deep into to the woods them closet person to me was @PERSON1 and i jumped up and grabbed her and from there i knew were going on adventure to go find whatever was living out there. @CAPS9 we started walking all i could see was trees and bushes tell i heard @PERSON1 say "there is something over there by the big tree with vines so we approached the tree with caution not knowing what was going to happen. We stood behind a little fallen over log that was there for awhile.As we watched the big tree and the huge hollow hole that was in the side of it we heard a loud growling nose from inside the tree i got up from behind the tree and went over to check it out but before i could take a step @PERSON1 grabbed my jacket and told it look to dangerous "alright" i said with disappointment cause i really want to go see what was in that tree. We started walking back to get the others turns out they have been looking for us for over @NUM3 minutes "sorry" we both said" but you guys have to check this out @CAPS7 so narly" i said with animosity. "@CAPS5 what is it" @PERSON3 said "don't know but it sounds big and scary and mean" said @PERSON1 " "oh daaanngg" @PERSON2 said "i think were gonna die if we got back over there" @CAPS1 complained. "@CAPS7 gonna be just fine" i said so we all looked at each other alright everyone said in a scared voice. "@CAPS8 is gonna be alright trust me i know a spot were we can watch the tree without getting close to the animal or whatever is in there"I said   @CAPS9 we were walking down there to go see the animal @CAPS1 didn't want to go see the animal anymore so we argued for a little bit then we all came to a agreement that @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 stay up the hill a little ways and we will run back if anything is wrong. We got behind the tree and watched the tree me @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 didnt know what to see or wait for @CAPS9 something would come out of that tree.  I could not wait any longer it was begining to take forever then i got up and said "lets go see what is in that tree" "im with you so lets @NUM4 said. We walking around the tree keeping our distance @CAPS9 we heard that growling noise again we backed off a little bit but kept going we got a little bit closer @CAPS9 i saw something some out of the tree. It was a huge mountain loin we ran as fast as we could up the hill. I was looking back trying to follow the sound of screaming from @LOCATION1 but @CAPS9 i looked up it was really @PERSON3 i could not help laughing @CAPS9 we got @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 i kept laughing all the way to @ORGANIZATION1. As soon as we got into @ORGANIZATION1 we were all out of breath especially me cause i could not stop laughing about @PERSON3 and how i thought he was @PERSON1 cause he was screaming like a girl. "@CAPS13 up" he said "that wasn't me it was @PERSON1" even though @PERSON1 was running beside me the hole time. We walked into a little more into @ORGANIZATION1 and there was a big box of donuts sitting right by the deli and we ran over there and got two box's which had a total of @NUM5 donuts in them then we got a big gallon of soda and chilled in @ORGANIZATION1 and ate the hole thing in @NUM6 minutes. I will always remember that day as one of the craziest days of my life.
