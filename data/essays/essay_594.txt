 I am going to tell you a story about when I was a young boy and, how I used to go on long trip with my father because he was a long-haul truck driver. Me and mi dad went many places around the @LOCATION2 all of them being very fun and amazing. And we all had a lot of laughs The one that i liked the most though was when we went to @LOCATION1 that place was so amazing there are so many things to do, as well as so many things to visit. Things that you could just see like the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 that was pretty cool i thought and all of the monuments. My dad told me to go and see if i could get past security at the @ORGANIZATION1 and i was like nah i am good you can though and i laughed at him; @CAPS1 place that i liked a lot that we went to would have to be @LOCATION3, even though it was very hot and muggy it was still fun. I remember my dad telling us that we had a lot of extra time and that he was going to be taking us to the zoo man was that cool we got to see all of the awesome animals such as the lions, the crocodiles, monkeys, gorillas , and the penguins. It was one of the best trips that my father ever took me on i liked it a lot. One of the funniest memories that i do remember is when we were driving throught the desert and there was this paper in the air and i did not know what it was so i was like, "dad what is that"? and he says "that is a falling star" i was like "in the middle of the day"? and it took me till about a couple years to figure out what it really was but now i know what it was and i just look back to that day and laugh.
