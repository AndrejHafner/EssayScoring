 My Laughter Story @CAPS1 you know that laughing really adds time to your life? Well you do now. Laughter is a great thing to have, because without laughter our world would be dull and pointless. On a day to day basis you should laugh everyday. Laughing can really help you get through a tough time.Me, @PERSON3, @PERSON1, and @PERSON4 were just hanging out up at @ORGANIZATION4's house one day and @PERSON4 was being really funny, all of us were laughing hysterically at what @PERSON4 was saying, then suddenly @PERSON2 calls us and wants to hangout and for us to come to @LOCATION1, but she said only @NUM1 of us can go. So we all debated on who was going to go. We came to a decision and @PERSON4 was the one having to stay back, but @PERSON1 gave him something to keep him occupied. So @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and I were mobbing the bus to @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. There was a tweaker on the bus and he was making us laugh so hard, but he wasn't even trying. So we arrived at @ORGANIZATION1. We were all hungry so we decided to get some @ORGANIZATION2. When we got to @ORGANIZATION2 we all just got a dollar burger which were rip offs so we all saved our pickles that were on the burger so when we left we could stick them on the windows. We @CAPS1 and it made us laugh so hard we could barley run away. When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION3's apartment we knocked on her door, no one answered, so we knocked again, no answer again. We were just about to call her when she walks out of a different apartment and we all just started laughing because we pounded on someone elses door. When we walked in there was a party going on so we were like nice. When we got there we all had a couple of beers. We were having such a good time we were all just laughing and have the greatest time. That next morning we woke up at @NUM2 a.m because we had to ride the bus back to @LOCATION2 early because it was @DATE1 and the buses run only for a little bit. When we got on the bus the bus driver was making weird faces like he was constipated or something but he made me laugh really hard.When we arrived back in @LOCATION2 we called up @PERSON4 to see what he was doing, he was just hanging out in town so we just went and kicked it with him for the rest of the day and later we all went home. It was a good weekend.
