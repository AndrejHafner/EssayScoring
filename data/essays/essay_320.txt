@CAPS1 do @CAPS2 know were my wax for my skin board is? I yelled to my @CAPS1 as i walked out of my room.I think it is on @CAPS8 book shelve but why do @CAPS2 need it?" my father replied.It's for @PERSON1's birthday present, I don't @CAPS4 any money for him and i promised him something amazing this year so i am going to take him to @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and we are going to ride are canoe down the giant sand dune.why cant @CAPS2 just get money from us or something and then buy him a card at the dollar tree? my @CAPS1 responded to me with a look on his face as if he were saying @CAPS8 the stupidest kid i know.@CAPS2 know i don't take handouts @CAPS1 i would @CAPS4 to work for that money and i don't @CAPS4 enough time to work for it and hangout with @PERSON1 all day, I mean it is his birthday after all and besides this is more fun I said with a mischievous grin on my face.Well alright the canoe is already hooked up to the truck, my @CAPS1 replied.That's fine with me pops, but can @CAPS2 give us a ride out there and back? I asked him trying that puppy dog face my sister always makes to get what she wants.Only if @CAPS2 stop making that weird face at me, do @CAPS2 want to drive? He asked me as we walked out the door to go pick up @PERSON1.Yes please, I said as he flipped me the keys.Pulling into @PERSON1's drive way i shut off the truck and stuffing the keys into my left front pocket i walked into @PERSON1's house. Walking into it i knocked on the wall and two heads turned to look up at me. One my best friend @PERSON3 a sandy short hair boy with a white face and the other was the birthday boy @PERSON1 who much like @PERSON3 had the same hair color but had pink rose cheeks. I thought i would fine @CAPS2 here i said . What's this adventure @CAPS8 taking me on today he asked? @CAPS2 will see soon enough i replied now throw on some shorts and get a crappy pair of shows I will be out in @CAPS8 living room watching the @ORGANIZATION1 win there game when @CAPS8 done. So leaving @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 to change I waited outside @PERSON1's room. Alright, said @PERSON3 we're ready now tell us. Not yet I replied with a mischievous grin on my face. @PERSON1 yelled goodbye to his mom as he closed the door behind us and we headed for the truck were my @CAPS1 was still waiting. So @PERSON1 said to my @CAPS1 as he got into the back seat do @CAPS2 know what @CAPS8 son is going to make us do today? Yes but @CAPS2 will probably want this one to be a surprise. Well why is there a canoe on top of the truck, are @CAPS2 going fishing @PERSON1? @PERSON3 asked as he climbed in next to @PERSON1. HA I wished laughed my pa as I started up his truck. Pulling out of @PERSON1's driveway I headed off towards the bridge and out of town, going straight towards @PERSON2. Turning into @PERSON2 I found a parking spot on the other side of an old car and shut off the truck, I tossed the keys to my @CAPS1 saying I don't think @CAPS2 will want me to @CAPS4 these in my pockets I said to my pa. There was only one other person there a drunk man waving a beer bottle around and sitting on a log. Putting the canoe into the water i tossed each person a paddle and said row to the other bank. As we reached the other bank we all jumped out and i pulled the canoe up onto the sand at the bottom of a massive sand duneWe are going to push this up the dune then wax the bottom and ride down the hill in it i said smiling madly at them bothYour stupid the commented together but were down they sad starting to push the canoe up the hill. As we reached the top we flipped the canoe over and started hurriedly waxed the bottom, then pushed it to a likely spot to slide down and all jumped in we slide forward a little but stoped. Without another word me and @PERSON3 jumped out and pushed with while running then jumping in we flew on down the sand dune and hit the water with a thud snapping the canoe in two as it flipped me out to a log ten yards away as i saw @PERSON3 fly out and hit the water with a cannon ball as @PERSON1 just fell out the side into the shallows. When i emerged i heard the drunk man yell from the other side of the bank."@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 THE @CAPS5 @CAPS6 IN THE @CAPS7 OF @CAPS8 @CAPS9' "
