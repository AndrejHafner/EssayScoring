Freshmen year, @CAPS1 season. I have been @CAPS1 for about eight years now, I made varsity in a @NUM1 school in @LOCATION1 my first year in high school. Being the only freshmen on the varsity squad, everybody knew who I was, "The short kid on the varsity @CAPS1 squad." @CAPS2 a eighth grader I won junior state and wrestled all the way through the brackets without @CAPS1 a full match. Meaning that I pinned everyone in the first round. I couldn't be touched. Going into high school I knew that I wouldn't have @CAPS2 easy of a time like in grade school. I was completely right. My coach had to be the funniest person that I have ever met in my life. @PERSON1 was my @CAPS3 teacher since the @NUM2 grade and has been my role model all the way through life. He made the funniest jokes about wrestlers on the team. A lot of people disliked @PERSON1 @CAPS12 @CAPS4 and him got along great. I ended the season freshmen year with @NUM3 wins, @NUM4 pins, and @NUM4 losses. I still to @CAPS13 day haven't been pinned. Which got @CAPS4 the wrestler of the year awarded by my @CAPS1 coach @PERSON4. When the season rolled around to regionals I knew that I had a shot to go to state. There were six guys in my weight class and four of the six I have previously beaten in early season. I had to just worry about my match ahead of @CAPS4 and wrestle mistake free.  At the @NUM6 pound weight class there is a bunch of little kids. I was definitely the most experienced in my weight class. I got seated first seed. The second seed was @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1. He dropped weight so he could try and take my seating for state. My first match I wrestled @CAPS5 from @CAPS6-@CAPS7-@CAPS8. The match was very short-lived. I pinned him in about @NUM4 seconds. After my match with @CAPS5 I walked to my coach and he told @CAPS4 a quote that I will never forget, "@CAPS10, @CAPS11's lonely at the top, @CAPS12 the view is excellent." @CAPS13 quote stuck in my head throughout all of my next matches. I won my second and third matches and was in the semi-finals. I was one round away from going to state automatically. I wrestled @CAPS5 from @PERSON3 and he weighed @NUM8 lbs. I knew that he was a good wrestler even though I had about @NUM9 pounds on him. I was getting ready to wrestle and I seen @CAPS5 warming up across the gym from @CAPS4. @CAPS2 he was jumping around getting warmed up I see him trip and fall on his face. My coach had seen the same thing and started making fun of him. @CAPS11 was the funniest thing that I have ever witnessed. I wrestled through the match and pinned him in double overtime to go to state. My coach walks up to @CAPS4 and says "@CAPS11 took you that long to pin someone who can't even warm up without falling on his face." @PERSON1 had about three teeth total in his mouth. He lost them from a lot of different ways. He was a adventure man. He loved white water rafting and loved the sport of @CAPS1. When I moved, I was far away from my idolized @CAPS1 coach, @CAPS12 we still hit @CAPS11 up on the facebook and chitchat. To @CAPS13 day, he is still the funniest man I know and still my idol.
