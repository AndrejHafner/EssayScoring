Laughter, an important part of life, just the feeling of laughing is comforting because at that time everything is okay.Laughing brings people together and makes them laugh together, its like a way of communication. Once you laugh about something other people start laughing and it connects everybody together to be happy. Its like telling everybody to be happy but without even talking to them.That's when people laugh with you, but when they laugh at you, well that's a different story.I remember one day when I was home washing the dishes and everyone in my family was frustrated, even me.I hate being mad and I hate it when people get mad, so I said something, I don't remember what but then everyone started laughing,it put everyone in a good mood.I think of laughing like fire,one candle can light @NUM1 candles.When you hear people laugh, the first thing that comes to your mind is,"something must be funny".And you want to go and see what it is so you can laugh too. that's very common for most people who like laughing. personally I love laughing because its a good weird feeling.
