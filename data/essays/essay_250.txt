 In the @DATE1, a primary group of friends would search for different adventures to part take in. This group of people consisted of kids of all ages, @PERSON5@NUM1, @PERSON1@NUM2, @PERSON2@NUM3, and @PERSON4@NUM4. Around late @DATE2, on a hot day, @PERSON5 got an idea to head over to @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2 and go cliff diving. He called it the "cliffs". So the whole group got together and took off on an hour car ride to @LOCATION2. Once they got there, it only got hotter outside, and the need for cooling off was getting to be a priority. They parked, then walked the train tracks. The closer they got to they're destination, the louder the voices that they @CAPS1 hearing became. The spot was a secluded area with a rocky floor, people getting a running start to jump off the highest peak and go crashing on to the waters surface below. Right away @PERSON5 and @PERSON1 wanted to get settled so that they could join the others. As for @PERSON4 and @PERSON2, it could wait. Once @PERSON1 and @PERSON5 got they're first couple jumps in, @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 thought that maybe it was time to try it. But not from the highest peak. Maybe something a bit lower. Something like the very bottom of the cliff, just for starters. Before they jumped off they noticed a little beach on the other side of the creek, so the girls conversed with the boys and they all decided to jump off at the same time, and swim to the little beach. Although they all jumped from different heights, they all seemed to arrive around the same time. For @PERSON5 it was a bit more of a struggle to swim that far. But @PERSON4 was right by his side helping him along the way. As the group relaxed in the @DATE1 air for a while, they became to realize that they @CAPS1 hungry, but much to lazy to swim back, climb up the rocks, and walk the train tracks back to the car. But hunger was taking over. As they swam back, climbed the rocks, gathered they're belongings and headed back, they started brainstorming for a place to eat. "@CAPS1 going to be going through @CAPS2." @PERSON1 said. "@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1!" @PERSON4 shouted. At that moment the decision was made. On the ride back, they switched drivers and sitting arrangements. Once they got to @CAPS2 they all stopped at @ORGANIZATION1 and filled they're stomach's up. They all chose to stop at @PERSON5 work @ORGANIZATION3, to say hi to some of his friends. @PERSON4 was @PERSON5 girlfriend so they had some showing off to do. They all finished up saying they're hello's, and went back to @LOCATION1 house where all the cars @CAPS1 parked. @PERSON4 and @PERSON5 decided to shower, while @PERSON1 wanted to play some video games, as for @PERSON2, she headed to home to shower and get ready to meet back up with her friends.  @NUM5 hours later, they all headed to they're hang-out spot, which they referred to as "the spot". They invited a couple of they're friends @PERSON6@NUM3, and @PERSON3@NUM7. They made a camp fire while the sun was setting because it grew to get colder, and colder. While @PERSON1, @PERSON3, @PERSON6 and @PERSON2 @CAPS1 sitting around the fire in chairs, @PERSON4 and @PERSON5 @CAPS1 riding around the camp site (which was really a huge hunk of @PERSON5 mom's land) on a quad. The group would take turns riding the quad but one ride in particular, made some memories. Once @PERSON5 and @PERSON4 came back, @PERSON2 wanted to give @PERSON4 a ride around. So @PERSON5 hopped off, and @PERSON2 hopped on, as @PERSON4 wrapped her arms around her waist, and they took off.  There was a certain trail where there was a long in the way of riding, so the driver would always have to find a way to maneuver around it. Usually it worked, this time it didn't. @PERSON2 hesitated to just ride right over it. She was afraid of all the power. @PERSON4 really didn't seem to care, and she took over and slammed on the gas. They high tailed it on the log and rolled the quad right over. @PERSON4 didn't weigh that much so she flew off, @PERSON2 on the other had got her foot caught under the handle. @PERSON4 got the strength to lift the quad off her foot, and @PERSON2 got right out. @PERSON4 decided to call the boys, and they hopped right into @PERSON1 to come save them. @PERSON5 flipped the quad right over and got on it and drove back behind the @PERSON1.  This memory will never be forgotten with in the group, even if the group will never be the same.
