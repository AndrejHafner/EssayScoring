 "Many other people believe that laughter is an important of any relationship." Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. I also agree with those thoughts.  I came to @LOCATION1 about @DATE1, I did not speak @CAPS1 at all that time. I started going school. I practiced saying my name, age, and where I came from before I go to school. Next day I walked in to school and I could see that everyone was looking at me. It was pretty scary to me. I looked back at one girl and she walked towards me.  "@CAPS2, my name is @PERSON1," the girl said. "@CAPS2, my name is @CAPS4. I'm from @LOCATION2. I don't really speak @CAPS1," I said to @PERSON1, then @PERSON1 started laughing so hard. "@CAPS6-@CAPS6 you have accent," @PERSON1 said, "it's really cute." I laughed back. @PERSON1 looked really nice with her smiles on and we became friends so quickly. She was my first @CAPS7 friend ever.  I always thought that making new friends are hard, but the laughter made it much easier than it used to be.
