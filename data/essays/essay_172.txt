 Laughter is a daily part of my life. I'm always laughing in school or at home. With laughter you can show many emotions that can't be told with words. To me, it's also a way of showing how fortunate your life is. I've had numerous occasions where laughter was the solution to my problem. I also agree that laughter is an important part of a relationship. In then next paragraphs, I am going to talk about how laughter affects my relationship and the benefits it brings to it as well. Approximately three months ago my family and I decided to take a trip to @LOCATION2. We planned to stay there for a month or so. When I told my boyfriend that I'd be gone for a month, right away I saw the sadness in his eyes. This truly killed me however, our decision was made and there was no turning back.  Our relation was tense during that month. We talked a few times but his voice was different. There was a sadness to it and I knew something was wrong. Although he said everything was good I knew his sadness was due to my absence.  After the month had finally ended it was time to come back to @LOCATION3! I was truly excited. We arrived at @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1 at @TIME1 on a @DATE1 @TIME2. I immediately called him but there was no chance of seeing him that same @TIME2. Although, just knowing that I was closer to him made me happy and anxious. We conversed for endless hours, telling each other that we would never be that far again. We laughed and laughed during our whole conversation. To me the sound of his laughter was a sign of his happiness and that was just priceless. The laughter was as if it had been a blessing to our relation. From that day on forward, I realized how much laughter really affects me in numerous ways. It's as if it brings happiness and prosperity to my life. With just a laugh sadness leaves and that's when happiness jumps in.
