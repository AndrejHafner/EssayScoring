   The day was not a fun one. We all just heard really bad news. None of us were even close to smiling. None of us. Even the people that you always see smiling, they had the most serious look on they're face. it was just a bad day. But then one of our friends, @PERSON1, had a great idea of going online to find something to cheer us up. It truly was a amazing idea. We spent hours on the computer just sitting there looking up ridiculous videos that we knew about. Trying to make each other laugh. That's when our day started to be a bit better. But it went back down a bit when a few people left to go home. Only three of us were still at @LOCATION1's house. @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I were all sitting there watching @LOCATION2 when a show we all loved came on. Psych. It was a new episode too! what a great day it turned out to be. The show is full of really puny and dumb humor but it fit all three of us. @PERSON1 the most. We were all laughing and having a good time. @PERSON1 was laughing after the show was over. So we asked what was so funny. He just kept laughing. For five minuets he was laughing. when he finally stopped we asked again. What was so darn funny. then he told us. " I was laughing at my own laugh. I sound really weird. " that's when we all started laughing. how could he be laughing at his own laugh. we soon realized how hard it was to stop. it turned out to be a okay day after all of what happened. Now, when ever we are having a bad day. we just bring up that day where we laughed at our selves for ten minuets. And the day is all better.
