 @CAPS11 was @DATE1, hot and dry hadn't seen any @CAPS26 for a few miles. We'd been walking for a good six hours now @CAPS18 snacking on left over jerky scraps. @PERSON3 hadn't said much today still pissed off about dropping the can-tine, I would've laughed if the duration of our lives weren't depending on that can-tine. Hadn't heard even a grain of sand shift along the dead dry dirt that day under the blistering sun. No wind no nothing. I looked up the sun was at @CAPS11's peak yet @CAPS11 felt like a few weeks had already gone by. Finally gaining the courage to crack open my wrinkled bloodied lips I managed to sputter something, "@CAPS1 sound good right about now, @CAPS3't you think?" @CAPS2 didn't even glance over at me, I couldn't tell if @CAPS2 was @CAPS18 ignoring me or that @CAPS2 was sun burnt so bad his skin would tear @CAPS18 turning his head. "@CAPS3't make me start singin, you know how bad I'm at singin. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 left me after I started singin to her." I began to chuckle. "@CAPS4 so I go'n die by myself? Make things better?" @PERSON3 finally speaking up, surprisingly with his neck still intact. "@CAPS5 wasn't so bad, @CAPS18 try to imagine that can-tine @CAPS31 had whiskey in @CAPS11. Know how much you hate @CAPS11, yeah?" I asked kicking a rock. "@CAPS4 did I ever start riding with you and them outlaws, should've @CAPS18 stayed back home become a lawyer at least make a name for myself." @CAPS2 muttered looking away. "@CAPS8 you did, now we can go on ahead or you can go on back that way and get lynched. Maybe go ask @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION2's body back by the rocks, give you another reminder of @CAPS9'll happen back down that way." I gazed into the distance not much to see, except a small brown dot couldn't tell @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was. "@CAPS9 you reckon that is?" @PERSON3 asked. "@CAPS10 some dead animal." @CAPS11 had been a few hours since we talked, the brown dot getting a little bit bigger as we drew closer. I still couldn't make out @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was, but I knew @CAPS9 I hoped for @CAPS11 to be. My boots began wearing out a few years ago now revealing a gaping hole of which my big toe couldn't resist sticking out of. "We're out of jerky, all gone." @PERSON3 grunted as @CAPS2 tossed the sack over his shoulder. "@CAPS9 do you think that is anyway?" @CAPS2 spatted. "@CAPS3't know but @CAPS11's pretty big and @CAPS29 sun is mighty hot, I reckon @CAPS11's got some nice shade under @CAPS11." @CAPS11 was nearly dusk, but the dot had grown remarkably larger a mile or so away from @CAPS11 now. "@CAPS11's getting dark, how we goin see where we steppin?" @PERSON3 asked watching every step. "@CAPS17 that hard to walk without lookin." "@CAPS18 think of @CAPS11 like @CAPS19 the tail on the donkey but having to walk to the donkey blindfolded." "@CAPS20, @ORGANIZATION1 sure knew how to through a party, her pies were mighty fine." @PERSON3 began fantasizing. Now walking with my arms stretched afar I'd knew if we we're at the object. I retracted my big toe through the hole as to restrain from stubbing @CAPS11 on a rock. Suddenly I heard a loud thud, then I felt something smooth, "I think we @CAPS28 @CAPS11," @PERSON3 said slowly, I now realizing @CAPS9 that thud was. "@CAPS21 be some abandoned jeep." "@CAPS9 we going to do with @CAPS11?" @PERSON3 asked. "@CAPS23." @CAPS24 up over the door onto the front seats the cushioning was firm but comfortable enough to call a bed. I woke to yet another hellish sun in the sky almost laughing down on us. There were a few compartments in the jeep that I began to search through for @CAPS26. "@CAPS9 you looking for?" @PERSON3 sighed as @CAPS2 slopped out of the jeep. "@CAPS26, @CAPS9 else?" @CAPS27 searching through old dusty papers I managed to find a rock hard piece of gum, a cigar stub, and a half empty bottle of @CAPS9 I'd hoped to be @CAPS26. Oh @CAPS9 I'd given for that bottle to have been filled with @CAPS26. Whiskey was all that I @CAPS28 inside the bottle. Getting out of the dirty automobile I @CAPS28 @PERSON3 sitting against the front tire. "@CAPS28 some of that favorite drink of yours," I said sitting down against the door. "@CAPS29 all you find?" @PERSON3 muttered. "@CAPS30." I starred out at the horizon, nothing but sand. "I'm scarred, you scarred?" @PERSON3 asked looking over to me. "@CAPS31 thing that scares me is the times @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 caught me snacking on her pies before supper," I began to chuckle. "@CAPS20, that is true," @PERSON3 laughed as @CAPS2 wiped drips of sweat off his brow. We @CAPS18 sat there for a few days, @CAPS18 starring and joking. @PERSON3 was a pretty swell guy, @CAPS11's a shame I brought him into all of @CAPS29. @CAPS2 died of a heat stroke. That desert was harsh and unforgiving, @CAPS11's something I'll have to carry forever.
