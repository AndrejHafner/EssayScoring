Iv always loved laughter in my life, I don't know how I could live with out it. This is how it all started out. One day, I was not having a good day. Nothing could have made me laugh. Friends would tell my jokes, they would make funny faces. That just did'nt make me laugh one bit. There was just that one thing they have'nt tried that made me laugh, until my sister completed that one thing. I would never forget this day when my sister and I had a water balloon fight. On a hot @DATE1 day my sister and I would always play water balloon fights, this one time she through one water balloon and it hit my face. I also through one water balloon and guess what happen it hit her face. We just could not stop laughing, we were just breathless from all that laugher. My sister desided to tell me that story when I was not having a good day, even when people tried to make it better by making me laugh. The one thing no one said was that one time during the @DATE1. Until my sister reminded me of it and told me that story. I just start laughing from that day on. Then my sister took me outside, she had all the water balloons ready, we start throughing them at eachother . That day when i was not good day turned out to be the best day of my life. Thats a day I would never forget from laughter. Thats why I love laughter in my life, it just makes my not good days turn to the best day of my life.
