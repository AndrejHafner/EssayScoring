One day me and my friend taylor got the idea on a snow day to get his quad and tie a rope to the back he was drifting around a post he didnt see the hill and i was on the back on a slead and i flew over the quad and got about @NUM1 feet high then crashed it hurt but it was so funny we both couldnt stop laughing for ten min.then we went back to his creek it was frozen about @NUM2 inch thick then i was drven the quad and he was in the back i was driving along the bank and he was on the ice then it started to crack so i went faster so he didnt fall in then after about two min the ice cracked and he went under then i got him out and i drove as fast as the quad could go and got back to his house he changed and then he just sat there and laughted for hours about what we both did.
