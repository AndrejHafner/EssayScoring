 One day @CAPS17 I was having trouble trying to cope with some very big changes in @CAPS13 life, I seeked the help of a friend. Usually @CAPS17 i'm having a bad day I @CAPS14 keep to myself. This was an occasion @CAPS17 I need someone else there to help @CAPS2. @CAPS17 I went @CAPS5 met with @CAPS13 friend she tried all she could to cheer @CAPS2 up but nothing was working. @CAPS6 she said "@CAPS1 hear a story?" @CAPS2 wanting to hear anything that would take @CAPS2 out of this slump I was curently in said "@CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS12 think it will help."@CAPS5 @CAPS6 she began.   "The other day @CAPS13 family @CAPS5 I went grocery shopping. We were gone for probably four hours. I stopped her right there @CAPS5 asked her how this was relavent to making @CAPS2 feel better @CAPS5 she said "The more details the funnier it is." I told her to continue. She continued, "@CAPS6 we got home @CAPS5 the parents started unloading the grocerys. While they were doing that @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 I were in the living room teaching our dog how to sit, lay, shake, speak, @CAPS5 roll over. Everytime she did a trick we would give her half a dog treat. @CAPS17 the parents were done putting the grocerys away they walked in the living room @CAPS5 we showed them the tricks we had taught our dog, they had yet to see them.   After we showed them all @CAPS13 father had to say was "@CAPS7 @CAPS3 @CAPS12 put the dog treats up @CAPS6 she doesn'@CAPS11 get into them." I replied with a simple "@CAPS8." @CAPS6 the parents said they would be back that they were going to get pizza because they didn'@CAPS11 want to cook after a long day of shopping, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 they left. While they were gone @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 I straightened up the living room @CAPS5 continued to train the dog. @CAPS17 the parents got back we all sat @CAPS5 @CAPS5 began to watch @CAPS11.V. @CAPS5 eat our pizza. After @CAPS5 while @CAPS17 everyone was done eating we were still in the living room @CAPS5 @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 I heard @CAPS13 dad in the kitchen complaining about not being able to find the cookies they @CAPS14 bought.   I looked at @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 said "@CAPS12 know what would be funny? @CAPS4 dad thought the dog treats were cookies @CAPS5 ate one." @CAPS13 sister giggled. Our dad came stomping into the living room @CAPS5 threw himself on the couch, acting like a four year old boy who @CAPS14 got his game taken away. We began to laugh @CAPS5 our dad looked over @CAPS5 scolded us, then looked back at the @LOCATION1. Then out of nowhere @CAPS15 said "I found them." Or what @CAPS15 thought was them. @CAPS15 reached for the dog treats on the coffee table.   @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 I didn'@CAPS11 dare speak a word. We watched him. @CAPS15 looked at the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS5 reached his hand into the bag of dog treats @CAPS5 pulled one out. @CAPS15 looked at us @CAPS5 we looked away momentarilly. Then our eyes fixed right back on him, beyone our control. We @CAPS14 had to watch. @CAPS15 looked away to the @LOCATION1 again @CAPS5 put a whole dog treat in his mouth. @CAPS15 began to chew. Then @CAPS15 slowed down his chewing @CAPS5 tilted his head to the side, @CAPS14 like a dog would. What a coincidience. Then it sounded like @CAPS15 choked on a piece of it @CAPS5 @CAPS15 began to cough. @CAPS15 spit dog treats all over the back of @CAPS13 moms head who was sitting on the floor.   @CAPS13 sister @CAPS5 I began to laugh histariclly beyond our control. @CAPS13 dad was @CAPS14 sitting on the couch with a straight face, I swear we could see the smoke coming out of his ears. @CAPS15 began to yell about how we should have put the dog treats up @CAPS6 this wouldn'@CAPS11 happen but in mid sentence, @CAPS15 @CAPS14 couldn'@CAPS11 help it anymore. @CAPS15 began to laugh. @CAPS6 we were all laughing, then we look at @CAPS13 mom who was still sitting on the floor in still in shock because she got sprayed with chewed dog treats. We could stop laughing, @CAPS6 then she began to laugh." @CAPS17 she told @CAPS2 this story @CAPS5 laughed @CAPS6 had I cried. Then I realized "All @CAPS12 need is a little laughter in your day to brighten your life."
