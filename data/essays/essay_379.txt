It's true @CAPS8 they say, time flies when you're having fun. On a particularly warm @DATE1 @TIME1, a rehearsal was in session for the wonderful production of "The @CAPS1 @CAPS2" and I was bringing my best friend, @PERSON2 some cheap but delicious food. We talked and ate for a while but eventually it was time for me to go. @CAPS3 we were walking down the stairs to get to the back doors of the building I asked if they needed any help with the play. "@CAPS3 a matter of fact we do!" @CAPS7 said enthusiastically. "We need a ladies costume @CAPS4."I had absolutely no idea @CAPS8 that meant, but I felt that the position had potential. "@CAPS5, I can do that. Just one question..." I said a little confused."@CAPS6?" @CAPS7 replied, slightly amused."@CAPS8 exactly am I going to @CAPS12 doing?" I asked her.We changed course and headed for the costume room so that @CAPS7 could introduce me to, @PERSON1 who would @CAPS12 my boss for the next two weeks. We arrived to find that @CAPS7 had already gone home for the night. A little exasperated, @PERSON2 told me the basic idea of the job."@CAPS9 basically @CAPS8's going to happen is that you are going to @CAPS12 in charge of the changing rooms and the costume changes on stage." @CAPS7 said quickly."@CAPS11 okay, I can do that." I replied with confidence.@CAPS3 I began to talk to her more about @CAPS8 I would @CAPS12 doing @CAPS7 said that @CAPS7 had to go because break was over. "@CAPS12 here at @NUM1 tomorrow morning and you'll learn everything you need!" @CAPS7 said hurriedly.@CAPS3 @CAPS7 ran off into the theatre I could hear the lead of the play beginning his lines. "In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice...."I left feeling more happy and excited than I have felt in months.  The next morning I made my way to the theatre which is located at the school which I previously attended. It felt odd going back there but at the same time so completely normal. I was even more comforted by knowing that I could see my friends everyday. I could hug them and laugh with them, I could have social interaction! Something that because of online school I have been lacking. I walked into the theatre and @CAPS3 soon @CAPS3 I did I was bombarded with excited people asking why I was there while hugging me tight. "I'm helping out with the costuming!" I said just @CAPS3 excited @CAPS3 they were. I broke away from the group of people and found, @PERSON2 who was on stage directing the lighting people. We talked for a while and then @CAPS7 took me to the costume room where, @PERSON1 was waiting for me. @PERSON1, was a classy looking lady. @CAPS7 wore a light grey cardigan and a colored top with some corduroy pants and sensible shoes. Immediately @CAPS7 started to tell me @CAPS8 my duties were and @CAPS8 I was going to @CAPS12 doing that day."I'm just going to have you watch the rehearsal today, just to get a feel of @CAPS8's going on." @CAPS7 handed me a pen and a pad of paper"@CAPS15 notes about where the lighting ques are and that kind of thing." @CAPS7 said.I walked out and wondered to the auditorium and took my seat in the second row of seats. The lights were lowered and rehearsal began. "In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice..."@CAPS16 I knew it, the end of the day had come and I wasn't in any hurry to leave. The actors and crew were doing such an amazing job with the play but I knew I had my work cut out for me. In the end it all worked out beautifully, we had some good shows and some @CAPS1 shows but the most important part of this experience was the time I got to spend with the people I love. I am going to miss them so much when I'm sitting in my room all alone doing the school work that consumes my happiness and laughter into the internet. on the other hand, I am all lined up to help with the next two productions going on at that old school of mine.
