I was selling some cookie dough for school and i waent to this olderly guys house. I went through the hole deal of raising money for my school and he said he was not interested. After that we got to talking i started making him laugh and eventaully he said "you make me laugh i like that i will buy some". I think that the laughter pklayed a key roll in him buying the cookie dough.
