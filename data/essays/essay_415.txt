 As warm @DATE1 days turned into chilly winter nights, the girls (@PERSON3, @PERSON5, @PERSON2, @CAPS1 and @PERSON4) and I were wondering what we should do to add a little pizazz to our life's. No one knew what was to come or the laughter we would experience. It was one of the biggest games in the @ORGANIZATION1 season. It was to determine whether or not they would go to the playoffs to compete for the @CAPS2. @CAPS1 is the biggest @ORGANIZATION1 fan known to man. She was of coarse, all decked out in @CAPS3 attire. We watched the game, had a few shots of apple juice and pigged out on @ORGANIZATION2.   Halftime was coming right around the corner and to say the least, the halftime show wasn't going to be all that and a bag of chips. I pulled my camera from my @PERSON1 look alike bag and pressed record. While I was walking around in a circle trying to get everyone in the video, @PERSON3 was having a little too much fun on a red exercise ball. She was bouncing up and down at least @NUM1 or three inches into the @CAPS7. A light bulb went off in my head. I handed the camera to @PERSON4 and slowly moved over to where @PERSON3 was bouncing. Just as @PERSON3 screamed, "@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7!" I kicked the exercise ball out from under her and when she came back down she was straight on her back!  @PERSON3 was too busy laughing and trying to breath to tell @CAPS5 how stupid I was. I was on the floor curled into a ball trying really hard not to pee my pants when all of sudden I hear this bang sound. I look up and the camera was lying on the floor next to @PERSON4, @PERSON5, and @PERSON2 who were laughing along with @CAPS5. @PERSON3 finally got the strength to get up. She came over and smacked @CAPS5 across the head and said, "@CAPS8't ever do that again." I'd say we had a better halftime show then the @ORGANIZATION1 did.  As the game ended, the weather changed and it began to snow. While everyone scurried to find their shoes, knocking into one another, I grabbed the camera not worrying if I got sick or not. We spent the last hour doing two of my favorite things; taking pictures and making memories. We went back inside and slowly went into slumber after drinking a little too much hot chocolate and apple juice. @PERSON3 has always been an early bird. I felt this sharp pain in my back and I shot straight up. Only to quickly realize that it was only her fist. Soon after everyone else arose from their warm blankets. Everyone @CAPS9 @CAPS1. We let her sleep and wondered outside again. It snowed. A @CAPS11. We thought of a plan and began to gather all the snow into one giant pile. @CAPS1 is a heavy sleeper so we picked her up, open the door that led to the backyard and plopped her right down in the center of the pile.  @CAPS1's eyes opened big and wide. Her mouth followed doing the same thing. She used every bad word she could possibly think of, including some in @CAPS12 that even she didn't know the meaning of. Soon, we were all in the snow laughing so hard we couldn't even @CAPS6 our breaths to apologize. @CAPS1 came to realize that it was an exceptionally good joke and began laughing along with the rest of us. In the end, we all had a good laugh and a cold to share that night. Laughter is the most important element in any relationship. It makes the bond between you and others stronger. Whoever said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people," was @PERCENT1 right.
