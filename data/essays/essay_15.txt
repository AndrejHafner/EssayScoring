    "Laughter is the best medicine." The phrase almost everyone has heard before. But it'@CAPS20 true! I've had days when all I could think about was how @CAPS23 life sucked, or at least seemed to. The days when you feel like everything is going wrong, and nothing could make it worse... And that'@CAPS20 when one of @CAPS14 best friends will make me laugh. I'll laugh so hard I'm on the verge of @CAPS19 @CAPS14 pants and @CAPS14 eyes water. I'll laugh so hard no sound comes out, @CAPS14 sides cramp and I fall on the floor. They make me laugh so hard, sometimes I think that even if I was in a coma, they'd say something so funny that I'd sit straight up in the hospital bed and @CAPS21 laugh the huge belly laugh that sometimes escapes me.    There was this particular time when @DATE1, @CAPS1 and I were feeling more giggly than usual. It tends to happen a lot when we're together, but this time was way different than the others. We staggered to @CAPS1'@CAPS20 house flushed and giddy at how funny everything was. You know how it is when you and your best friends @CAPS9 @CAPS21 @CAPS13 so tickled by each other? Those times when you glance at your friend and @CAPS21 as you've begun to calm down, you see her pinched expression from trying not to laugh, and you lose it all over again. If you've ever had the pleasure of experiencing these silly moments, try imagining that feeling for hours at a time. I'm pretty sure I developed a whole new set of abdominal muscles that day, if that gives you any idea how hard we were laughing.    Anyway, we stumbled into her house, trying to get serious, since we did have to do at least some of our homework. Of course we were starving after all that laughing, so @CAPS1 told @ORGANIZATION1 and me that we could get some cereal. @CAPS21 regular milk and cereal, right? There'@CAPS20 nothing @CAPS22 special about @CAPS4'n @CAPS5 (besides that it'@CAPS20 freaking delicious). But on that day, everything was out of the ordinary, especially the milk. It was the most amazing milk I'd ever tasted, and I @CAPS6, @CAPS6, @CAPS6, milk, so that had to mean something. "@CAPS7 this milk is so good! @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS8!" @ORGANIZATION1 exclaimed. I swear she was about to choke on her own spoon, she was eating so fast. "@CAPS9 you kidding me with this? What kind of milk do you buy?!" I blurted out. For some reason that milk was really extraordinary, and it was seriously blowing @CAPS14 mind. "@CAPS10, I don'@CAPS17 know. Two percent?"@CAPS1 looked at us incredulously, a curious eyebrow raised at our inquiries. Her expression made us all fall apart in peals of laughter. Now whenever one of us brings it up, we still laugh like it @CAPS21 happened.    @TIME1, it happened. @CAPS1 peed her pants, and not @CAPS21 a little. It wasn'@CAPS17 @CAPS21 the idle threat rushed out, the "@CAPS12'mgoingtopee!" squeal. @CAPS13 no. She actually peed herself, and I still @CAPS16'@CAPS17 even remember what I said to make her laugh that hard. All I know is suddenly (scaring me half way to death), she yelled out, "@CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS8 I @CAPS16'@CAPS17 @CAPS18 @CAPS19! THERE'@CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22 @CAPS23 @CAPS24!!" I whipped around and saw @CAPS1, red-faced and open-mouthed, supporting herself against the counter. She looked like the freaking @CAPS26 @CAPS27 of @LOCATION1 all bent over like she was. Her eyes were closed tight, crinkling at the corners, a few stray tears escaping as she tried to hold in shrieks of (apparently) crippling laughter. It took me a second to realize what was going on, and then I was totally straight out laughing at her; pointing and laughing @CAPS14 shoulder-shake laugh, and it only made her laugh harder. Still laughing, she did a penguin-type run down the hall to the bathroom, where @DATE1 was. @CAPS1, in her wet jeans and with a red, tear streaked face, burst through the bathroom door, looking slightly bewildered and amused with what @CAPS21 happened. So naturally, @ORGANIZATION1 laughed at the sight of her, in her comically delirious state. Who wouldn'@CAPS17 have?   The fact that we @CAPS16 always laugh at each other and ourselves is why I love @CAPS14 friends . It'@CAPS20 great when you have people that you @CAPS16 laugh about everything and nothing with. @CAPS1 is practically a walking ego boost because she laughs at every joke, and @ORGANIZATION1'@CAPS20 pretty clever when it comes to thinking of them. Personally, I love laughing, especially with (and mostly at) @CAPS14 best friends.
