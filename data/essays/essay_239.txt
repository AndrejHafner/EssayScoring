 One day i was with my friend @PERSON1. We had been friends for a really long time. I was in a bad mood that day because my dog, taco ran away and i had gotten into an arguement with my parents. @CAPS4 asked me if i wanted to go out on a walk, and i said i did. We were really good friends at this piont, and @CAPS4 always knew when something was wrong, even though i think i hide @CAPS1 pretty well. As we wakled, we walked past children playing at the park with thier parents, and a man playing fetch with his dog, @CAPS1 was sunny and warm. @CAPS1 was durring the summer-time. We stood on the bridge for a minute, then @CAPS4 asked me "whats wrong, @CAPS2?" @CAPS3 @CAPS1 odl him everything that happend, i told him that my dog had ran away and that my parents were mad at me. I told him that i was sad. I dont know why i opend up to him like that we hardly ever talk about our life drama. we're always laughing and making jokes. I thought @CAPS4 liked me, actually i was hoping @CAPS4 did. I liked him, i had for a while.  We started talking about everything that was going on in our lifes, school, friends, parents, and alot more. @CAPS4 put me in a better mood. We decided to go to the park and sit at the pic-nic tables. We sat across from eachother, and sat there talking for a while. Then @CAPS1 started getting late and i had to get home. I said "thanks for cheerig me up, i really needed to laugh and smile today." @CAPS4 looked at me, and took my hand in his and said "@CAPS5 should always laugh, because @CAPS5 never know who is falling in love with your smile." and then @CAPS4 kissed me. That is the a day i'll remember for a long time. I'm still with @PERSON1, we've been together for almost @NUM1 months now.
