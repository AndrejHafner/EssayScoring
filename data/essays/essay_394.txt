 It was the first day of sophomore year. I had just moved to @LOCATION1 during the @DATE1 so I was nervous about the new school just like any kid would be. I walked into the school and checked out @CAPS4 surroundings. Everything seemed normal enough until I saw it. Near the middle of the sea of tables in the cafeteria was about four tables with around @NUM1 people at each one, but it wasn'@CAPS5 the fact that they were there that caught @CAPS4 attention it was what they were doing. They were dueling with @CAPS1-@CAPS2-@CAPS3 cards right there in the middle of the cafeteria where all could see! I was baffled, I mean I used to duel when I was younger in elementary school when the game was newer, but I had to quit cause everyone in @CAPS4 school stopped dueling, and here I am looking at at least @NUM2 highschoolers just dueling away. What surprised me most of all was that they were right there in the open where everyone could see, and worst of all judge. I moved to a table nearby them and began to watch a kid named @PERSON1 (who later has become one of @CAPS4 best friends.) mop the floor with his opponent. I quickly caught back on to most of the rules, and went home that day thinking "I'm gonna get back into that game!". So I bought a deck, and continued @CAPS4 recon of the tables, @CAPS4 deck sitting in front of me waiting for someone to challenge it's master. A few days went by as I continued @CAPS4 silent observation of the duelists. Finally a duelist named @CAPS5.J (another one of @CAPS4 now good friends) challenged me. I accepted and began. He then proceeded to thoroughly kick @CAPS4 butt in the space of what seemed like five rounds into the game. @PERSON1 then taught me he how to play better and we became best friends. He is a really funny guy, and to this day I cant hang around him without laughing. Through him I have met tons of great friends. Even now I wonder what @CAPS4 high school life would be like if they didn'@CAPS5 attend @CAPS4 new school.
