                            On @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is a true story about a time that i had with two of my friends/squad member named @PERSON3 and @PERSON1. When we were walking @CAPS3 cheer-leading practice on a @DATE1 @TIME1. We had a good laugh going @CAPS3 @NUM1 and I were getting cold, because we were in shorts and sweatshirts, @CAPS8 we put on @CAPS1 hoods. @CAPS6 @PERSON3 wanted @CAPS3 put her hood up also @CAPS8 she didn't feel lonely, but her hood was @CAPS3 small and with thick hair it just made it worse for her. @CAPS8 she tired @CAPS3 put her hood on anyways and her hair went on the top of her head and her curls are at the bottom of her hair. @CAPS8 when when she put her hood on it made her look like a poodle.When we got @CAPS3 the end of the block that I live on @PERSON1 said her foot was hurting, @CAPS8 i told her i would give her a piggy back ride. @CAPS8 she got onto my back, and i told her @CAPS13 we get @CAPS3 the end of this block set me down and we can cross the street @CAPS6 give me a piggy back ride, @CAPS8 @PERSON1 gave me a piggy back ride. @CAPS8 when we crossed and @CAPS6 we told @PERSON3 that it was her turn @CAPS3 give one of us a piggy back ride, i was about @CAPS3 get on @PERSON3's back the @PERSON1 said "@CAPS5 just got a turn! Now it's my turn!"@CAPS6 i was like "@CAPS7 @PERSON1. Okay @PERSON3 give me your backpack and water bottle." @CAPS8 @PERSON3 gave her stuff @CAPS3 me and gave @PERSON1 a piggy back ride. @CAPS6 @CAPS13 that we got @CAPS3 the end of the block, I told @PERSON3 that she now had @CAPS3 give me a piggy back ride. @CAPS6 @PERSON3 was like "@CAPS9! I'm @CAPS3 tired" In the end of that conversation she gave me what i wanted.At the end of that last block @PERSON3 set me down and @CAPS6 we crossed the street. @CAPS6 @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 drove by us yelling "@CAPS10!" @CAPS6 we turned around @CAPS3 see who yelled that at us, and we found out it was @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6 I said "@CAPS12 look it's @PERSON2! She is actually here on time!" @CAPS13 @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON2 us, we three girls started @CAPS3 just bust out laughing. We started @CAPS3 laugh because of what @PERSON2 yelled out at us.When @PERSON2 went @CAPS3 go park her car, we just started walking up @CAPS3 her @CAPS3 talk @CAPS3 her, as she was getting out of her car.@CAPS8 when @PERSON2 got out of her car we were just getting @CAPS3 her car. She walked up @CAPS3 us and we started @CAPS3 talk and walk into the school where we practice. As we were walking i said @CAPS3 @PERSON2 "@CAPS5 are actually here on time!" @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 responded by saying "I know right?!" We finally got @CAPS3 the doors @PERSON2 said "@CAPS12 everyone is here today!"  @CAPS8 that is a time that i had a good laugh with more @CAPS6 just one person. Going @CAPS3 that practice was a blast that night. That night was fantastic going @CAPS3 cheer leading practice. Hope @CAPS3 have that much fun going @CAPS3 practice again.
