                       Laughter   @CAPS1 is like a drug that works better than any other painkiller, or anti-depressant out there. It makes angry people happy, and happy people ecstatic. One of the best ways and more common ways to have a good laugh is by watching a funny movie. Any time I'm asked @CAPS10's your favorite comedy I say "@CAPS2 with @PERSON1". I remember the first time I watched a @PERSON1 movie. I was about @NUM1 years young; I was in second grade, it was towards the end of the school year, and I couldn't wait to get out for the @DATE1 and just have fun. It was any ordinary boring day @CAPS7 school and I remember walking home hoping there would be something fun to do when I got home. I walked in the door to see my brother watching @CAPS3, I asked him @CAPS10 he was watching but he just ignored me so I went to my room to do homework. I finished my homework and walked into the living room and plopped down on the couch next to my brother, I asked @CAPS10 he was watching a second time, he let out an annoyed sigh and said some movie called "@CAPS4 @CAPS5" was about to start. Within the first five minutes we were already @CAPS1, not just giggling or slightly chuckling, tears were rolling down our faces from all the @CAPS1. I remember saying to my brother "@CAPS6 is the funniest movie I've ever seen!" @CAPS7 the end of the movie my brother and I couldn't stop quoting the movie, every @NUM2 seconds we'd quote it, it was non stop laughter. We sat there on the couch patiently waiting to see @CAPS10 was on next wishing and hoping it was another movie as incredible as the one we just watched, and sure enough after the commercial break we learned that it was a @PERSON1 marathon, and on next was "@CAPS8 @CAPS9". The movie started out just as funny as the last one, with @PERSON1 doing something completely idiotic, yet absolutely hilarious, like growling @CAPS7 some dogs over a loudspeaker. We couldn't get enough of @CAPS6 guy, my brother was rolling on the floor @CAPS1 and crying, and I was still watching waiting to see @CAPS10 happened next. About half way through the movie my mom got home from work, she walked in to see my brother and I in hysterics, she said "@CAPS10's so funny?" We just pointed @CAPS7 the @CAPS3 right as @PERSON1 started rolling down a hill. Soon enough our mom was watching it too, @CAPS1 just as hard as we were. I was having a great time, a genuinely great time with my family, @CAPS10 more could I ask for? How about another @PERSON1 movie? On next was a movie called "@CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14", completely ridiculous, and completely hilarious, @CAPS10's funnier than an overweight guy trying to be a @CAPS14? We continued to watch the movie until dinner time, we inhaled our food as fast as we could and then raced back to the couch to continue watching. When it was time for bed I remember staying up late reciting quotes from the movie in our bunk beds until our mom came in and told us to be quiet. I don't know how we slept @CAPS7 all after @CAPS1 all night. The movies left us speechless, we had never seen @CAPS2 funnier, they made us laugh, they made us cry, they made our stomachs ache, and through it all it brought my brother and I closer. To @CAPS6 day my brother and I can sit down and watch one of those movies and laugh and remember all the times we have watched them before and all the laughs we shared, I swear half of my childhood consisted of @CAPS1, and @PERCENT1 of that @CAPS1 came from those movies. The movies helped me to develop a funny personality, they shaped @CAPS10 I think is humorous, and they make me realize that after sharing something so funny with someone I love, that laughter is an important aspect in our lives, without it life would be plain and dull like a meaningless blob of clay. Have you ever gone a day without @CAPS1? If so you know how long and dull it can get without having something that brings a smile to your face there. Laughter brings people together, it brings out the best in us, when you're mad or upset the best way to cure your anger or frustration is by having a good laugh.
