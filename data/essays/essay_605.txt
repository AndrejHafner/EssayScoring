One time I was sick, and I told my mom "I need to get some ice tea" so I get up and go to the freezer. Suddenly my throat gets irritated and I feel the need to cough, so I do and instead of coughing on the side I do it right into the ice bucket. And it just so happens that my mom was standing next to me, and she says "@CAPS1 god! son what was that?" so we started laughing. It was ironic because the germs would be preserved in the ice box it was funny I was keeping my germs alive and my mom used that ice.
