 I think laughter should be a huge part in everyoneas life. For examlpe; laughter has brought my mother and I closer than we have ever been before. One time we were sitting in her camper and we had not been with each other for a whole month so we just let everything out, and laughing was one of the things. We were laughing about fake teeth, we laughed so hard that I made my mom tinkle her pants. We talked about fake teeth for about an hour. I think laughing makes everyone feel better about themselves, it does me. Laughing is a good way to show someone that you know how to have fun and it's not a bad thing. For someone to know how to laugh and to have fun is a good way to start a friendship or even a relationship. Another example is; @CAPS1 I'm with all of my friends I can never stop laughing, and I love it because I'm not sad. @CAPS1 I was a little girl my family and I went to disneyland and it was the beast time of my life there was not one moment @CAPS1 I was not laughing with all of them. One thing I don't understand is how someone couldn't be laughing or smiling at least @CAPS1 someone says or does something funny. Well back to my story of my mother and I, We were all tired and had a long day and fake teeth just made us all laugh, and laugh it was the best time I think I have ever ahd with my mother. I have always said to everyone I know "live life while you can you don't know how long you'll have it." I think that those words are very true and while your living life, laugh. My grandfather is pretty funny to @CAPS1 he is in a good mood he is always making everyone around him laugh. One time he had seen this commercial and it was a plastic grandpa singing "I'm not your daddy I'm your grandpa" and it said that maybe four times, and ever since he heard that he sings it all over the house. In conclusion laughing is the best way to feel better about anything. So @CAPS1 your blue just think about something that will always make you laugh and laugh about it.
