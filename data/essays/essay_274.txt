 It is often said that laughter can bring people together. I hold that knowledge to be true. We've all laughed at one point in our lives, whether it was in a group of people, or just laughing, and having a @CAPS9 time. Reality is we are all connected to each other in one very simple way, we all have laughed in our lives. Laughter to everyone means something different. To @CAPS15 laughter can mean that I'm happy and full of life and other times it can simply mean that I feel I really don't know @CAPS22 to do. There's one time though that it meant both. It was a cold, and rainy @DATE1 day in @DATE2. I was with my friends watching movies. When I'm with my friends typically that means we're talking about the latest thing, guys, hair, and whatever else. "@CAPS1 my gosh @PERSON3!" We heard @PERSON2 scream as @PERSON1 and I walked into my room. "@CAPS1 boy." I thought, "@CAPS3 we @CAPS7 again. I new it would be a mistake to have both of them @CAPS3 at the same time." @PERSON1 and I exchanged glances, I new she had the same thought going through @CAPS28 head.  "@CAPS4, @CAPS22 happened this time?" @PERSON1 sighed as we entered the room only to see the two of them going at each other, violently tugging each others hair, slapping each other, @CAPS29 did everything imaginable to each other before I lost it. I hate seeing my friends @CAPS7 at each other the way @CAPS29 were. "@CAPS4!" I finally yell. "@CAPS3's @CAPS22 we're going to do. You," I pointed to @PERSON3, "@CAPS7 and sit over there." @PERSON3 walked out of my room and sat down. "@CAPS4, @CAPS9. @CAPS14 can't you two just relax and enjoy this time and act like you two are friends? For at least another six hours?" I looked at each of them, @CAPS29 nodded in response. "@CAPS9, @CAPS14 lets @CAPS7 finish the rest of this movie, or play a nice quiet game." I sighed, hoping the worst was over. @PERSON3 walked back into my room, and laid on my bed, we continued through the movie peacefully. "@CAPS10't @CAPS11 @CAPS12 just a comical genius?" @PERSON2 said starring at the screen. We started laughing at @CAPS28 because @CAPS28 eyes seemed to be stuck on only him. "@CAPS1 my gosh @PERSON2!" @PERSON3 said laughing. "@CAPS14 who's calling who crazy?" @CAPS15 and @PERSON1 both looked at each other and started nervously chuckling. The tension in the air was almost to thick. @PERSON2 had on @CAPS28 game face for that comment.  I leaned over to @PERSON1 and whispered, "@CAPS1 this is not going to be pretty." We started preparing for the worst. "@CAPS17 grab @PERSON3's arm and drag @CAPS28 if you have to, out of this room." @PERSON1 jumped to @CAPS28 feet and got @PERSON3 out of the room, with just enough time for @CAPS15 to pin @LOCATION1 to my bed. When @CAPS29 had left and the door was closed I let @CAPS28 up but kept myself between @CAPS28 and the door. "@CAPS4, @CAPS22 is going on with you two?" I nervously asked @CAPS28.  @PERSON2 started to laugh a sort of villainous cackle that sent chills running down my spine. I couldn't help but give out a scared sounding chuckle, that only influenced the situation more. This could only mean one thing, my original intent, to not invite one of them, had just been confirmed, we were in for it. I slowly started backing away and headed out of my room to see @CAPS22 @PERSON3 had to say, since I never actually got anything out of @LOCATION1. I inhaled and headed down the hall to them. "@CAPS4 @CAPS22's going on? You two haven't ever had this big of a fight before." @CAPS20 started flowing down @CAPS28 cheeks, like a stream flowing steadily down a hill.  "I...I don't know @CAPS22 h..happened." @PERSON3 said still weeping. "I j..just wanted to a..ask @CAPS28 @CAPS22 ha..happened today." @CAPS21 and @PERSON1's faces just had that looked of, @CAPS22 happened that we missed.  "@CAPS22 did you mean when you said @CAPS22 happened today?" I asked. I was at a loss of words when she gave @CAPS15 @CAPS28 response. "@CAPS23 that's all that happened? You two were going to rip each others hair out over a guy?" @PERSON3 looked at @CAPS15 and simply said yes. "@CAPS4 come in @CAPS3." All three of us walked inside. I sat on the bed next to @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 was in the middle protecting @PERSON3. "@CAPS4, this is pointless. @CAPS23 you both like the same guy. Big deal get over it! @CAPS29 just make things more complicated anyway." I looked to both of them, @CAPS20 streaming down both their rosie cheeks. "@CAPS14 can we just forgive and forget?" @CAPS27 filled the room. @PERSON3 crawled over, the metal frame of the bed squeaking as she did. "I'm @CAPS23 sorry, @PERSON2. Can you forgive @CAPS15?" @CAPS28 face tear stained and red eyed, @PERSON2 was @CAPS17 to reply. "Of course I forgive you." @CAPS29 hugged with @CAPS20 still streaming down their faces. All was well again.
