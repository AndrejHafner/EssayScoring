 There is @CAPS28 more fun than going to a friends house after church. It is like a comic relief in life after a r rough message to @CAPS10 heart. In @CAPS1, going to your friend's house is even better when your friend is, to say lightly, kind of crazy like @CAPS10 are. Which for my story, could be interpenetrated as a bad thing, but for me it is @CAPS28 but a great thing. My friend and I have had some of the craziest time together, and the funny thing is we @CAPS6't have to be doing anything illegal too! Its such a bonus! We get our giggles from cleaning, playing with magnets, and watching theVampire @CAPS2, and much more. Strange? Yes. Fun? To much. Let me tell @CAPS10 of somethings that have happened to my lovely friend and I . First, like always, there is a @DATE1 and I'm heading over to my good friend's house. Its a very short walk, I leave my church by twelve and am there by twelve o' five. I'm up the steps, I'm to her door, I open it. Bark bark bark! "@CAPS3 up, @PERSON1," @CAPS4 yells from another room. The snowzer pup come and greet me. He knows @CAPS11 better. The one dog eats rocks for @CAPS5 sakes. But @DATE2, @CAPS15 has her reasons to yell, and be a little grouchy.  "I didn't realize how many dishes there were! My sister will freak if @CAPS15 knows your here and they are not done." "@CAPS6't worry, I'll help @CAPS10, and we'll get them done before your sister notices."  @CAPS7, we are off. @CAPS4 wonders the house frantically for dishes and putting them in the sink. @CAPS7, I work on putting the clean ones in the dishwasher away. We hear a sound from her sisters room, and we jump. @CAPS4's sister sounds like @CAPS15 is waking up but @CAPS7 snorts and the noise ends. @CAPS7 we get back to work. When we got done, we @CAPS21 slumped on to the couch looked at each other. We @CAPS21 were tired and our hearts were still pounding. @CAPS7, her sister snorts again. we laugh hysterically, and her sister tells us to @CAPS3 up. @CAPS7 another day, I come over and we are @CAPS21 really hungry. We @CAPS21 haven't eaten all day long and go into her kitchen. "@CAPS8 do @CAPS10 wanna eat," @CAPS15 asked me. "I @CAPS6't know. @CAPS8 do @CAPS10 wanna eat, " I replied back. "I @CAPS6't know, " the endless cycle. But, @CAPS7 my eyes cross paths with a bag of chocolate mint chocolate chips. @CAPS4 fallows my gaze and see the bag, and smiles. "@CAPS9!!" I'm delighted, " @CAPS9!!" we @CAPS21 shout in joy of the idea.  We get everything together, and begin making @CAPS9. Now, @CAPS21 of @CAPS16 are really, "great cooks," so when we were faced with "who should flip the @CAPS9", it was a @CAPS11 brain-er.  "@CAPS10 do it!" "@CAPS11, @CAPS10 do it!!" We argued till I realized the pancake was about to burn, and @CAPS7 I did indeed, "do it," for the sake of chocolate mint chocolate chips @CAPS9. But, when I flipped it, it didn't really want to end its embrace with the hot pan, and broke into pieces. Many "stupid pancake's" were said and spread all over her kitchen. But, eventually we ate and were happily full. @CAPS7 came another @DATE1, and this time @CAPS4 had a surprise. "I found this really cool show!! Its calledVampire @CAPS2!" I thought for a moment, "@CAPS14." @CAPS15 immediately dragged me to her computer where @CAPS15 had them down loaded. I thought to myself, "are these a cheep knock-off ofTwilight?" We began watching them and they did seem cool, I liked them a lot.  The vampire brothers were in turmoil with each other, yelling and interrogating each other. "@CAPS16 @CAPS19 of how her blood tastes!"  I paused the none existent thought in my head, "@CAPS8 did he say?" "@CAPS16 @CAPS19 of how her blood tastes," @CAPS15 looked at me. I crack up laughing, "@CAPS20. I thought he said, @CAPS16 @CAPS19 @CAPS8 her butt tastes like, wow I feel bright!"  @CAPS21 of us start laughing like crazy at the very stupid thing I had said. We laughed the rest of the night with @CAPS16 that. We finish watching a couple episodes and @CAPS7 my mom shows up. I get my coat and the rest of my junk, and head out the door. the dog is still barking, but @CAPS4 comes out the door with me, we give each other a hug and say our good byes. "@CAPS23 I'll talk to @CAPS10 later, @CAPS4, " I say heading down the steps "@CAPS25, see @CAPS10 at school tomorrow."  "@CAPS26. And see @CAPS10 next @DATE1!" I yell from the car window. @CAPS15 yells back, "@CAPS27!" @CAPS28 is more fun than that, a friends house on a @DATE1 @TIME1. Especially with a couple of crazies things, like me and my buddy, dirty dishes, a stupid dog, @CAPS9 that stick to the pan, andVampire @CAPS2 with my poor hearing.
