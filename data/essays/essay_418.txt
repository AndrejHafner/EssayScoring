 A great day for an adventure @CAPS5 my sister invited me to her christion school called @PERSON1 , @CAPS1 was a nice sunny day and then @CAPS1 turned in to a not so sunny day. Woke up first day of visiting my sister in her new school ,went to all her classes with her ,the teachers were kinda wired and so were her friends ,after second period in @PERSON1 we went to her @CAPS2.E class the teacher said to put on running shose besause we are going to run up a mountian, my sister had forgoten to put on her running shose so the teacher sent me and her to go get them after we got the shose the class was already a quarter of a mile away from the school so me and my sister desided to take a short cut so we took the off road "the seanic root". We had ran down a hill and @CAPS1 was really a steep , my sister got half way down the hill and slid on her butt all the way down after she went I went so I ran down the hill faster then I had ever ran in my life and I hit the pavement at the bottom I was like a tumble-weed in a huricane my sister helped me up and we started running tword the class and they were in "shock" of what me and my sister looked like my sister looked like she had just got done playing in the mud me on the other hand looked like I got hit by a truck and my face was covered in dirt, @CAPS3 after me and my sister got back we decided to get cleaned up, so we went to the showers the showers at @PERSON1 are similer to the ones in @CAPS4.H.S but with shower curtins the shower that I had used the curtin had came off this medel hook and I wasnt being smart and used a plastic stepping stool the ground was still wet from @CAPS5 I had took a shower and the stool sliped and my pinkey got cought on the hook and I sliced @CAPS1 open on a main vain in my pinky I started getting light-headed and I passed out my sister and her friends took me to my sisters room and put a band-ade on @CAPS1 @CAPS5 i was still passed out. After i woke up i found my self between a blanket and a really uncomferterbul bet my sister was waiting for me to wakr up and told me to never scare her like that agien , @CAPS5 she said that I told her how I thought @CAPS1 was funny @CAPS5 we ran down the hill I didnt do much damage except for give me some scrapes and how my pinky made me pass out.
