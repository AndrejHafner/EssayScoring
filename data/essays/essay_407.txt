                  Laughter I have many friends. My friends and I are always doing silly things to have a good time, and pass the time. We are laughing all the time. There is not one day where we are together and we do not laugh. My friends and I believe that laughter is an essential element of life. One, blazing, @DATE1 day my friends, @PERSON2, @LOCATION3, @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, and @PERSON3 , all came over to my house. We were all bored, and hot, so we wanted to decide on something exciting to do. @LOCATION3 said, "@CAPS1 don't we go swimming you guy's?" We all agreed. My friends and I could not agree on where to go swimming though. We couldn't go to the pool near my house, because it was to crowded. We also, could not go to the lake, because it was too far, and we had no way to get there. My mother was working, so she could not give us a ride. @CAPS6 then said, "I know you guy's! @CAPS1 don't we just have a water balloon fight right here at @CAPS2's house?" We all responded, "@CAPS3 let's do it!" A little after, the @CAPS4 went to the store nearest by, which was @ORGANIZATION1, to buy water balloons, and water guns. Once they got back, they started filling them up right away. While us ladies changed into our bathing suits. After, we all decided on who was going to be on what team. The first team was @PERSON2, @PERSON3, and @LOCATION1. The second team, and the best team, was @LOCATION3, @PERSON1, and I. Both teams were all ready to go. Each team had buckets full of water balloons, and water guns. The teams were on different sides of my mom's green suburban. We were going to start throwing water balloons at the count of three, but the opposite team cheated and threw a water balloon before. Oh, but they did not realize that we had the hose on our side. @PERSON4 chased @PERSON1 across the yard. She caught up to her and soaked her with her water gun, but @PERSON1 threw a huge water balloon at her. It exploded right on her face. We all started laughing. Then, @PERSON2 and I started throwing water balloons at each other. We ran out, so we started using our water guns. Those too eventually ran out. @PERSON2 was all out of resources. I grabbed the hose, and I turned it up to full power. @PERSON2 tried to run but he slipped and fell. I completely hosed him down. My team had won the first @CAPS5. It was time for @CAPS5 two now. We had filled up more water balloons, refilled our water guns, and gone to our sides. We all counted, "One! Two! Three!" @CAPS5 two had started. @LOCATION3 started chasing @PERSON3. They went around the suburban at least five times before he caught up to her. He caught up to her on the grass. The grass was really slippery from when I got @CAPS6 wet, so they slipped, and fell down. @PERSON3 slipped first, but she took @LOCATION3 down with her when she was trying to get back up. We all started throwing water balloons at them, which made it harder for them to get up. @PERSON3 managed to get up she went on the side where her team was. They started throwing everything they had at us. They soaked us up. We had lost the second @CAPS5. Now it was time for the final @CAPS5. The @CAPS5 that decided who won, and who lost. We filled up double the water balloons, and double the water guns. No one got the hose that time. We thought it was not fair. Both teams lined up on different sides of my front yard. My team was on the right side, and the opposite team was on the left side. We were against who ever was lined up in front of us. I threw the first water balloon at @LOCATION1. Then @LOCATION3 threw at @PERSON2, and after @PERSON3 at @LOCATION2. Who ever moved out of line lost. @PERSON1 was the first to lose. @PERSON3 had thrown a big water balloon at her that knocked her out of line. We moved a step closer. It was now three against two. @LOCATION3 then water gunned @CAPS6 down. We walked another step closer. @PERSON4 and I were going back and forth at each other, but @PERSON4 had no more water balloons after a while and her water gun was empty so I beat her. We moved another step closer. @LOCATION3, and I easily soaked @PERSON3 down. My team had had won! We all cheered, then went back inside to dry off, and have some ice cream to celebrate my teams success. That day we proved that anyone can have a great time with some good friends, imagination, and a lot of laughter. I believe that everyone should laugh on regular basis. There is no need for sadness of anger in life.
