                                        The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4                                          @CAPS5 @PERSON1 is an essential for me to survive this crazy thing called life. So instead of writing about one experience where laughter is a key element I am going to write a montage of true events where laughter shows my true colors as to who I am. I think I should start with my blond moments first seems how that's my natural hair color. When I was little I would take my shirt off, throw it on the ground and be like "mommy, I can't find my shirt" @CAPS6 would tell me, "@PERSON1 @CAPS21 just threw it on the ground", I would look in all the wrong places and result to crying on the floor. @CAPS6 would pick my shirt off the floor hand it to me and then I would do the same thing all over again. Yeah @CAPS21 could say I was a little embarrassed when I got older and they had it on video camera, but that's what I love @CAPS21 grow up and laugh about what was once embarrassing and @CAPS21 move on.  There was another time when we figured out my initials spell @CAPS7, so whenever I go swimming with my brother and our friends, they start singing the @CAPS8 theme song and I start laughing because if I let them think I don't care they will eventually @CAPS4. Guess what, they still haven't stopped and I am beginning to think I @MONTH1 be stuck with the nickname @CAPS8 for the rest of my life. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 kept rolling when I was in first grade my brother, who @CAPS5 the way was in second grade, decided to tell my first grade teacher I had @CAPS10, @CAPS6 called my parents, who began to laugh like crazy and told her yeah, @CAPS6 does its a little thing called @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14. Looking back its funny because I remember the look on @PERSON2's face; @CAPS21 could say it was classic.  As I advanced in my @CAPS16 years moving into @CAPS15 @CAPS16, I joined an organization; the @CAPS17 @CAPS18 of the @CAPS19 for @CAPS20, where I learned later on that the color black is prohibited at any and all @CAPS19 functions. Well, the night I was initiated I wore all black from my hair accessories to my shoes. I felt no embarrassment just the need to laugh. I found later that I like to make jokes or funny comments whenever I get nervous during a speech, so when I had to get up and give a speech in front of approximately one-hundred and twenty people I made little efforts at making jokes and comments, did I mention I wasn't very @CAPS1 at jokes, but the ceremony went on and people went along and laughed with me, even though I hit my head against a dream catcher.  @CAPS19 has taught me its okay to cry at the depressing things in life, its okay to fear the things that frighten @CAPS21, its okay to love anyone @CAPS21 want, its okay to live your life, but most importantly its okay to laugh at your mistakes. I think that is one thing I will always remember and pass on to my children when I settle down with a family, which won't be for awhile I learned that lesson when I was babysitting my little cousins, who were sick, its a lot of responsibility, its a @CAPS1 thing my brother helped because I would of been nearly lost without him.  I know that because of the people who surround me with their positive attitudes and hearts gold that they have formed me to become a better person, to laugh when there seems no way out, to not only learn from your mistakes, but to laugh at them as well, to show that @CAPS21 have a deeper meaning for the way your life was meant to be lived. Remember that when life hands @CAPS21 lemons take the opportunity to make some sweet lemonade and then throw it on yourself so @CAPS21 and your friends can get a @CAPS1 laugh every once in a while. Thank @CAPS21.
