So we got tired and so we layed in the grass and wached the clouds we just layed there and looked and pointed at all the coulds that were in funny shapes and formed like peoples faces it was funny so we stared to make funny voies to go along with with the clouds as they went by us we hade so much fun just laying there and laughing and waching the clouds go by.
