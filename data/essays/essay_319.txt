 Laughter plays a huge part in my life, my family loves to laugh. We are always making each other and people around us laugh. @CAPS8 you put two or more @CAPS1's together someone is going to start cracking up. Sometimes the kids in my family have games to make each other start @CAPS4.  There is this one @CAPS2 that a couple of us play; no one ever oficaly gave it a name so we just call it theLaughing @CAPS2. The @CAPS2 starts out with one person standing in froung of everone else thats playing. The goal of the @CAPS2 is to try to get one of the other people to start @CAPS4, and the first one to laugh has to trade places with them to do the same thing. We really dont play that often just @CAPS8 their'se nothing else to do. One night my two nefues and I were just siting around looking for something to do @CAPS8 my little nefue @PERSON2 said "@CAPS3 play the @CAPS4 @CAPS2". His older brother @PERSON1 and I didnt really want to play but there was nothing else to do so we bouth said that we would. It started out like it always did nobody really wanted to go first, but @CAPS7 sombody finly maned up and just went. @CAPS7 it got started. After that everbody was @CAPS4 and having a good time. It went on like this for a while, but after about a houre or so it started to get boaring. @PERSON1 and I were strating to get board out of our minds so we were going to ouit, but my little nefue didnt want us to. @PERSON2 went up to take a turn. @CAPS8 @PERSON2 went up for his turn, he started out like he usually did just making stupid faces and funny sounds to try to get people to laugh. We had seen all of his faces and herd all of his noises so it wasnt going to work. @CAPS7 after he realised that we wernt going to laugh he started telling us a story. He started the story out by saying "@CAPS6 this guy right; he didnt have anything besides his chair and his box. He loved his chair and his box." The story wasnt very funny yet but he went with it. "@CAPS7 the guy went to bed because he was tired and all, and @CAPS8 he woke up his stuff was gone. His chair and his box the only two things that he had in this world were gone. So he went looking for his things. He was searching all day and night but he couldnt find anything not his chair, his box, or even a clue of where they could have gone. So he disides to go to bed and maybe they would be back in the morning like maybe it was all a dream; but @CAPS8 he woke up he had turned into a wild boar." @CAPS8 he said that @PERSON2 started running around acting like a pig. That got us @CAPS4 but he didnt want to stop there he just kept telling his story. In the story it turnd out that everytime the "guy" went to bed something strange would change and it just got more and more funny. My family loves to laugh and have others laugh with us. Just like my nefue @PERSON2 he didnt want to stop telling his story because he had us cracking up. Weather were just hanging out and telling a couple of joaks or making up a @CAPS2 we love to laugh. Lauchter has a huge part in my life.
