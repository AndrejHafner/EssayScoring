 In most stories mothers and daughters are either enemies or friends, in @CAPS13 story however, we are both enemies and friends well; at one point we were that way. Not @CAPS4 much anymore. I'm sixteen now and she's forty and were just friends, I mean she's still @CAPS13 mom and she still can punish me as her daughter as she pleases but we work it all out and laugh it off. Approximately seven months ago @CAPS13 mom moved from @LOCATION4 to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 I chose to stay behind to finish high school with @CAPS13 current friends. When she moved, the way we acted with eachother would be different, and it is, we act completely different with each other we now cherish the little time we have and I'll explain how. At the beginning since as early as I can remember, @CAPS13 mother and I would always fight over the dumbest things, we never got along. And here is what I think the reason is. I'm her daughter I was born just like her, her face, hair, eyes, everything, even @CAPS13 attitude and the sound of @CAPS13 laugh. She's stubborn I'm stubborn and we both like to argue, not really with other people just with us two, but if we were to go into business together things would get done, say if we became lawyers we'd work great together because I inherited her work ethic and we both like to argue valid points. But as I grew up a bit more and we experienced traumatic times together we began to see the brighter side of life, and that just having each other around is enough to keep us from falling apart. Events in our life that we went through brought us together @CAPS1 it was all finished and done. What I mean by that, is we stopped arguing, we comforted each other when we needed comfort, we became friends, and I believe laughter had a lot to do with it.  @CAPS13 mom, her name by the way is @LOCATION5, once said "Laughter brings two people together as a whole, the one thing that human beings all know how to do is laugh and its something we can all share." @CAPS1 our life had settled down and we were able to live normal, like with a house and lights and a dog with a yard, things were good between us we still fought often but never as it used to be. Which would consist of throwing objects across the room at each other, like I said things are better now. We one night discovered, that laughter is something we both use to block out the things we no longer wanted to haunt us. I love to sing, @CAPS13 mother and @CAPS11 had me grow up around music like; The @CAPS2, @LOCATION3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and many others but we would sing a song together something that only the two of us shared and it was "@CAPS3're @CAPS4 @CAPS5" by @PERSON3. But we would sing that specific song in the car, we would sing it in front of our family and @CAPS1 the moment was over we would laugh about it, because for once was something that only @CAPS13 mom and I shared and it was special. Laughter played a big part of who we are as people today. There are always things people do together, @CAPS13 mom grew up in a strict @CAPS6 @CAPS7 home, she also had four sister's and @CAPS8 was a very serious matter. @CAPS13 mom and I went to @CAPS8 together and we always tried not to take life @CAPS4 seriously all the time, @CAPS4 while in @CAPS8 we would start @CAPS15 about some kind of ugly bug on the wall, or she would laugh at me because I would drop the prayer book on @CAPS13 foot, but we would always laugh." @CAPS10 it or I'll bring @CAPS11 @CAPS12 over here and @CAPS3'll have to take an extra religion class."@CAPS13 mom would say as I'm poking her or making fun of her and i would say " @CAPS14 wont make me take an extra class I'll tell him @CAPS3 started it." That's who @CAPS13 mom and I were and were still like that. Even though she moved to @LOCATION2 for a new job, and @CAPS4 she could see the man she loves more often than every six months, we still talk, and like I said we laugh when we cry and boy do we cry a lot, especially on the phone when I tell her I miss her.  That is the story of @CAPS13 mother and the laughter that we have shared for the last sixteen years, and to quote @PERSON1 "@CAPS15 is the best calorie burner." I do believe that and @CAPS13 mom and I see it as that, @CAPS15 is the one thing we can do when we don't feel @CAPS4 hot or don't feel like ourselves, @CAPS4 yes she is correct when she states that laughter brings two people together, and it's positively true, we have a better relationship than ever.
