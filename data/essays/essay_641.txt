                                Coleslaw"@CAPS1's get out of here before they wake up @CAPS2." @PERSON2 said, standing up with her blanket wrapped around her. I did the same, brushing grass of my pillow. Disappointment was rushing over me, I actually wanted to see the meteor shower. "@CAPS3 coming @PERSON5?" I asked, looking at my old friend in a new light.  "@CAPS4!" @CAPS14 said and gave me a look of pure anger.  All of us were supposed to be in bed at ten, it was @NUM1 am. It was week five at @CAPS5 @CAPS6. We had made new friends and met new people. @PERSON2 and I were @CAPS15 to help disabled children and @PERSON5 was @CAPS15 to hit on all of the cute guys the worked up @CAPS15 all @DATE1. As @PERSON2 and I walked @CAPS9 to @LOCATION1's camper to return her sleeping bags, I couldn't help @CAPS16 feel mad. That was the third time @PERSON5 had been rude to me @DATE2 and i didn't understand what her problem was. It could have been jealousy, @CAPS16 @PERSON5 didn't like @PERSON3. My mind was going a thousand miles a minute and I knew it was going to be a @TIME1. We reached @LOCATION1's trailer and opened the squeaky door. @CAPS15 @CAPS14 was, laying on the couch in her pajamas. Her daughter, @PERSON1, safely tucked away in bed. "@CAPS7 girls!" @CAPS14 exclaimed, "@CAPS8's @PERSON5?"  "@CAPS9 on the field watching the shower with her real friends" I said, making air quotations with my fingers.  @PERSON2 rolled her eyes and re gripped her pillow and blankets. "@CAPS10! @PERSON4, can we sleep in here tonight?"  "@CAPS11!" @PERSON4 said, "@CAPS12 in and lock the door behind @CAPS3."  We walked in to the trailer and locked the door. As we plopped down on the beds @PERSON4 made some chocolate milk. "@CAPS13, ladies!" @PERSON4 started out, handing us each a glass full to the brim with delicious milk, "I want to know the good gossip! Why is everyone mad at @ORGANIZATION1?"  "@CAPS14 is mad at me because your daughter likes me more." @PERSON2 said, shrugging and taking a long draw of her drink. "@CAPS15 is that." I said, "@CAPS16 the other part is a long story. So yesterday I was talking to her about @PERSON3. @CAPS3 know cute core-guy @PERSON3?" they nodded, "@CAPS17 I told her about a conversation @CAPS20 and I had @CAPS8 I told a @CAPS18 stupid joke and out of pity @CAPS20 laughed and said 'that's cool' I was @CAPS18 excited and @CAPS14 was laughing at me because i was jumping up and down."  "That doesn't sound mean." @PERSON2 stated. "@CAPS19! @CAPS14 then went on to tell me that @PERSON3 doesn't, and never will, like me. @CAPS14 said that @CAPS20 just thinks am stupid and feels sorry for me." I was almost shouting, "I mean out loud I agreed with her @CAPS16 in my head i was scream furiously @CAPS20 loves me! We are gonna get married someday!! I decoded his words with my heart!!" I slammed my palm against my chest and pretended to cry. Then I couldn't help @CAPS16 laugh. All three of us were laughing hysterically at my faked passion. "@CAPS3 should right skits for @CAPS22!" @PERSON4 said, gasping between fits of laughter. Suddenly @PERSON2 stopped laughing and said, "I @CAPS18 want some coleslaw! Random @CAPS23!"  "I could go for some coleslaw right about now." @PERSON4 shrugged. "I could go for some @PERSON3-slaw right about now!" I said, smiling. Instantly new laughter erupted from everyone. I thought about how much humor this story would lose every time i retold it in the future. Some how I knew that I couldn't do it the justice it deserved. The laughter started to settle. We sipped our milk quietly, thinking. As we did i looked out the window to see @PERSON5 walking our way from across the field. With a groan I got up to unlock the door. "@CAPS24 it!" @PERSON4 said, "and turn off the light. Anyone who hate my @NUM2 year old daughter doesn't need to be here." I flicked out the light and made my way @CAPS9 to the bed. @PERSON5 got to the door and tried the handle. When @CAPS14 found that it was locked @CAPS14 softly knocked on the door. Then @CAPS14 waited. We stuck our faces in pillows to muffle our uncontrollably laughing. Giving up, @CAPS14 walked away through the gravel. We all burst out laughing, unable to control ourselves. Looking at the clock, @PERSON4 gasped, it was @NUM2 in the morning and @CAPS5 would be starting in @NUM4 hours. It was time to get some sleep. @PERSON4 went @CAPS9 to her bed while @PERSON2 and I said our good-nights and rolled over. The trailer went quiet. Laying @CAPS15 I thought about the happiness created by us. I knew that @ORGANIZATION1 would be @CAPS25. @CAPS16 her being mad was worth what I learned. That @TIME1 I found out that if your happiness makes someone mad, that's @CAPS15 fault. Be happy and enjoy life! Anger is bred from the joy of others. So why not be @CAPS26? It beats the alternative, doesn't it?
