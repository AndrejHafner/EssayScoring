Like when someone's upset, @CAPS2 just a have a good laugh and make yourself feel better. Ok I know I crack a few jokes here and there, @CAPS2 what i like to laugh alot it feels good, it makes me happy, and other people happy. I'm in foster care and i can't get out @CAPS2 laughter is an important part to my life at the moment. Even if I'm down it makes me happy to hear some one else having a good time.I miss hearing my parents laugh.My mom was an amazing mother, she had a funny laugh that would get me to grine, smile and just bust out laughing. We always had a good time, I remember when my mom took her meds @TIME1 and the pills make her a little hiper. @CAPS2 my own mother wanted to box me.@CAPS2 i had boxing gloves and she just had her fists, @CAPS3 my mom knew how to fight and every thing. @CAPS2 that experionce was a little scary. Ok enough @CAPS5 my mom, @CAPS4 my dad he was an exepttional man and father.He worked hard to support me and my brother. When my brother and I were younger my dad would always put on funny masks and do funny things to get me and my brother to laugh. Or he would put on a scary mask and scare us tp have himself a laugh.My father would go roller blading with us and try and trip us but he couldnt always keep up and if you got going to fast his legs would wobble and he would fall and me and my friends would just laugh.Every my parents past me and my family has been seperated and it sucks but laughter to me is there world right @CAPS4. I could have been my fathers twin, think hard @CAPS5 that.What Laughter Is All @CAPS5 ''Laughter Is The Shortest Distance Between Two People''. And ''I @CAPS6 Believe Laughter Between Two Or @CAPS7 People Is An Important Part Of Any @CAPS8 Of @CAPS9.''
