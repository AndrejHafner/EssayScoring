  Can you imagine life without laughter? Life without laughter is plain, dull, and boring. Laughter is an important part in life. There would be nothing to look forward to if laughing didn't exist. Laughter creates memories, relationships, and it fills in the awkward silence between two people.   Some people don't realize how important laughing is. Life without laughter is like life without water. I think that's how important laughter really is. The quote "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." is true, but laughing is more then just an element. It's way more important than that. Well I guess we could all live without laughter, but who would want to?  No laughter means no fun times like: swimming, water parks, ice skating, dancing, etc. Those fun things can lead to laughing. Without anything fun to do no one would look forward to tomorrow. Everyday would be a waste, if there wasn't any laughter in the world.   Some people might just think that laughing is just an element. Why is that? Laughter is important enough to be more than that. For example water is an element because it has something to do with the earth. It stands for the ocean. Laughter doesn't fit in that category. Laughing has such a huge impact on our lives. Laughing makes everything tens time better. Laughing creates memories, memories creates relationship. That's why laughter is an important part in any relationship. It's amazing how the smallest thing can make such a big difference in our lives.
