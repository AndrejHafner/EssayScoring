 Have you ever experienced a time with your friends or family where you laughed so hard your stomach hurt, and your eyes were filled with tears? Laughing is something every person needs. A great laugh can make a persons day and put a smile on their face. If no one laughed the world would be a terribly sad place.  My friends and I are always laughing, to the point where were rolling on the ground, clutching our stomachs laughing. We sometimes laugh over absolutely nothing. I honestly don't know who I'd be if I didn't laugh, or what I would become. I remember this one time when my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1, and I were having a off day. We all woke up in bad moods and everything seemed to be going wrong, especially since we were woken up by my mom in the kitchen banging pans and pots around. When we woke up our favorite cereal was gone and so we wanted to go to the donut shop but no one would take us, and even though I realize that's not the end of the world now, it seemed like it then. My brother and sisters, with the @LOCATION1 blasting and running around the house yelling, were irritating us and we were already mad. The dog and cats, who kept trying to keep sneak in the house, were annoying us too. The weather outside was all gloomy and disappointing. We were all ready done with the day before it had even started.  We eventually decided to get up and get ready. We came up with a plan to walk down to river behind my house even in the poor weather. The river was after our big backyard and past the quad track so it was about a mile away. When we asked my mom if we could go down to the river she said no she didn't want us walking down there by ourselves, which we had already done a few times before. We begged until we knew she wasn't going to let us. That put us yet again in a foul mood. We had to go find something new to do and it didn't seem like there was many options. We lived clear out of town about @NUM1 miles, not exactly walking distance.
