 When i think of a day where laughter was the element, i think of @DATE1. That was one of the worst days of my life. I had plans to break up with my girlfriend.  That morning, my decision was final, and i was going to do it. For some reason when i woke up, i felt sick. That day, everything was falling apart. Around @NUM1 @CAPS1, i went to my girlfriends house, and broke up with her. The next day, i couldn't smile to save my life. The whole day my friends were making me smile, and showing me they cared. The next day i felt so much better. I was smiling and laughing like nothing ever happened. All day my friends were telling me jokes, and being really stupid. They made me laugh so much.  Throughout those upcoming weeks, i met another girl. I couldn't be anymore positive about my life. All i do now is just smile and laugh. I don't need to live my life with sadness. All i can do is just be positive, and smile. Laughter is very important. No one should go a day without it. Just lets just lives our lives to the fullest, and put the past behind us. Just think on the bright side, and smile.
