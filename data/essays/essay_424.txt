so one time my friends chad, justin and i ding dong ditched this old man. the reason we did this is because we would walk by his house everyday and he would turn on his sprinkler and this annoying alarm thing. so at like nine or ten at night we walked over to his house, banged on his door and ran. it was so funny cuz when we got back from running we went to our friend taylors house and we where sittting in the garage just basking in the glory of what we had just accomplished. about ten seconds later we heard banging on the garage door. at first we where kinda startled so we ran into taylors room, and thats when it happend... the funniest shit ever, the old mad just started scearming and banging on the door then he yelled "come out boys what are you afraind of?!" and we just crack up in laughter. well he totally knew we where in there so he went to the front door and started banging on that, waking up taylors mom. wel we ended up going out and talking to the guy and he said he called the cops cause he said it happened all the time. and we denied it was us, but it totally was so we couldnt help but laugh in his ugly face. he seriously looked like a turtle crossed with an eighty year old rapest. he had liver spots on his face and a terrible grey combover that wasnt fooling anyone. by the time the cops showed up the guy was long gone and we told the cop he was senile and didnt know what the hell he was talking about. so we got off scotfree. it was funny and awesome.
