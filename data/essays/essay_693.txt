 They say laughter is the best medicine @CAPS15 I personally think that's true. For one jokes are a great thing fro laughter but it depends on the joke sometimes because some jokes are extremely funny @CAPS15 some or @CAPS14 plain horrible. Another reason why laughter is @CAPS5 great is when your laughing that automatically means that your in a good mood @CAPS15 i love to be happy or in a good mood i hate being all mad @CAPS15 upset it @CAPS14 isn't me. I @CAPS14 love it when i cant breathe i am laughing @CAPS5 hard those are the best jokes also you @CAPS11 about wet your self especially if your extremely ticklish @CAPS15 i know quite a few people that are @CAPS15 i feel sorry for them because i would be down right embarrassed if i wet myself in front of anyone. My whole life has had laughter in it to me anytime is laughter time.  Well I have quite a few stories about laughter but i am only gonna tell you one @CAPS15 its one of my favorites its when me @CAPS15 my friends are all hanging out at at mt grandmas house for my @NUM1 birthday party @CAPS15 were all having a great time on the homemade slip @CAPS15 slide the food @CAPS15 the drinks (soda of coarse not alcohol). But anyway my cousin @PERSON1 has these games that he came up with like the @CAPS1 relay , @CAPS2 fishing , @CAPS3 the gum in the whip cream, @CAPS15 my favorite @CAPS4. @CAPS4 is a game where you @CAPS11 have as many players as you want @CAPS15 all the supplies you need are a lot of sting a lot of balloons @CAPS15 one person to start out as the @CAPS4. @CAPS5 say you have @NUM2 humans @CAPS15 one @CAPS4 all the humans would have balloons tied around their waists @CAPS15 they all try @CAPS15 run away from the @CAPS4 @CAPS15 the @CAPS11 hide anywhere inside the boundaries @CAPS15 it doesn't matter how your balloon pops who pops it or what pops it once it is popped @CAPS6 your a @CAPS4 until there are @CAPS12 humans left @CAPS6 you start a new game. Now you might ask yourself why this is funny @CAPS15 now I am gonna tell you why. @CAPS5 were all at my party having a great time right @CAPS5 my cousin @PERSON1 says "@CAPS5 who wants to play the game @CAPS4? " @CAPS6 we all say well whats that?" @CAPS6 he goes over all the rules like a said before @CAPS15 we say "lets play." @CAPS5 me @CAPS15 my friend @CAPS9 are running away @CAPS15 all of the sudden we start hearing my cousins @CAPS4 noise that means he coming @CAPS15 he freaked out @CAPS15 ran away @CAPS6 when he leaves you @CAPS14 hear the screeching scream come out @CAPS15 you here his balloon pop that means that he got out @CAPS15 were all @CAPS14 laughing because when he flew he launched about @NUM3 feet backwards it was the funniest thing ever because when i got over there he was still on the ground @CAPS15 everyone @CAPS14 it trying to breathe i swear i think everyone was about to wet them selves @CAPS15 the probably would've laughed some more if it wasn't for the game @CAPS15 @CAPS6 @CAPS9 got up @CAPS15 started chasing people with my cousin @PERSON1 @CAPS15 the rest of us @CAPS14 ran out of there as quickly as possible @CAPS15 yet again you here my cousin making his @CAPS4 noise @CAPS15 people running @CAPS15 screaming @CAPS15 my friend make trying to make the same @CAPS4 noise but cant @CAPS15 one by one i hear the balloons popping @CAPS15 soon i was the last one left @CAPS15 i was gonna give up @CAPS5 i am @CAPS14 getting chased @CAPS15 chased until i am completely out of breath @CAPS15 @CAPS6 one of my friends @ORGANIZATION1 comes up in front of me @CAPS15 i @CAPS14 said "I don't care @CAPS14 get me out i @CAPS14 wanna lay down." @CAPS5 he took the balloon @CAPS15 @CAPS14 popped it @CAPS15 i asked "@CAPS11 i take a nap?" @CAPS15 he said "@CAPS12 because we have to get ready for the next round @CAPS5 you better rest up quick or you'll be dogging." @CAPS5 i @CAPS14 rested up as much as i could before we got everyone straped up for the next game i was hoping to get some kind of reward for winning the very first game of @CAPS4 but @CAPS12 my cousin @PERSON1 had to be a samrt alic about it @CAPS15 say" @CAPS14 getting to play the game isn't a big enough reward for you stingy!"@CAPS15 as always everyone starts @CAPS14 busting up laughing at every single little thing that my cousin @PERSON1 does but i do have to admit that he is one of the funniest guys that i have ever met. @CAPS5 there you go there is my story about laughter but i do have plenty more but i think ive wasted to much of your time @CAPS5 thats all i have to say.
