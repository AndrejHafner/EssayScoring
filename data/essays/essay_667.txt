 The elements of laughter is to show emotion to other to let them know that you had a great time or to show that there are special. Laughter is some times in me. I laught when I have a great time. The greates laughter I always have is with friends saying crazy thing when we go to the bus after school. That the joy from friend and you to reales the tens strees from school. I always go home with a smile. Theres always jokes to tell to have joy. When the bell rings with in the end of my last class, I am tierd from working hard. When I go to my bus located on the front of the school. I feel strees out from the work I had to do. But I can't wait till my friends come to the bus. We always have a great time. I comepletely forget about school and laugh with the jokes and rediculace story we say. When we get to the first stop everyone gets out with joy even me. This prosses has lasted for three years. But the next year is going to be ower last ride from the bus @NUM1 my favorite number. I hope we will still have the great time.
