   Humor is a huge part of who i am,and i love making people laugh, but this story is about an event that made my whole family fall down laughing on the floor. It all started one @DATE1 when my cousin received a trampoline for his birthday. It was a great day not only for him but for the rest of us kids too because we all could go and play on it whenever we wanted. We were always over at my cousins house after that. We would have competitions to see who could jump the highest or who could do the coolest trick. Sometimes we would fall off or one of us would get hurt and then my aunt and uncle wouldn't let us play on it for a while but they would always cave and let us back on it. It wasn't until a few months later that we all witnessed the funniest accident that any of us had ever seen in our life time. It all started out at my aunts birthday party. Usually she had it at some fancy restaurant but not this year, this year she decided just to have it at home to save some money. So we all show up for my aunts party my mom, my brothers, and me. First off we do all the regular birthday things, the meeting of family members, eating some food, and singing happy birthday. Basically in my eyes it was all the boring stuff. I mean come on there was a trampoline out in the back yard just waiting to be jumped on but the adults wouldn't let us get anywhere near it until we had ate. Finally everyone was done eating and they were going to let us kids go have our fun. It started off as normal as any other day we went to play on the trampoline but little did we know that all of our stomachs would be hurting from laughing in a few hours from an even that was about to transpire
