                Twins For a @CAPS1  Laughter is a large part of who I am. I am a very happy, outgoing person, and I love to laugh. I especially the laughs that make your stomach feel like its going to fall out of your body and continue laughing on the floor. That's @CAPS23 I surround myself with people that are like me, that's my best friend @PERSON1 and I are like two peas in a pod. People tell us all the time that we look like twins, and when we're together @CAPS24's like a hurricane of loud, crazy laughter. The best part of our friendship is that we are alike I think, and we use @CAPS24 to our advantage. One @CAPS1 @PERSON1 and I were taking a stroll downtown. We were just window shopping,when we past a clothing store that had on display a auburn tank top that had blue swirls coming up from the bottom and up one side, also a pair of dark blue jeans with a rip in the knee. @PERSON1 and I fell in love with the outfit, and as we stood outside the window like ravenous dogs drooling over a piece of freshly cut meat, an idea hit me.When I turned to @PERSON1 and said " @PERSON2? (her nickname) @CAPS2 if I was you and you were me when we @CAPS14 meet @CAPS3 later?". She turned to look at me, and her eyes lit up like @CAPS24 was @CAPS4. We ran into the store and bought the outfit. We looked in the mirror and we both knew we could pull this betrayal off. The pants fit our curves, that were identical, like a glove, and the tank top rested on our bodies in the same pattern. The only difference was she was a bit taller than me and my hair was longer than hers, but we deiced that showing a little neck wouldn't be to bad, @CAPS7 we just threw our hair up in buns and called @CAPS24 good. As we left the store, we got asked if we were sisters, and we replied in a simultaneous "@CAPS5, kinda" @CAPS24 was reassurance that if we could trick them, then we could trick anyone.  We comfortably walked towards the county library lawn where we were meeting @CAPS3. when we were close to the lawn of the library @PERSON1 turned to me and said "hide behind this tree, tell I head back, and then sneak around back and freak him out!"@CAPS7 I hid behind the tree while she went up to say hello, he asked where I was and she said "I do not know actually"while she dug in her bag, "but I think I dropped something down there, I'll be right back, stay put." "@CAPS8" he replied. All the while I was sneaking around the back of the garden and I hopped down off of an embankment and said "@CAPS9 I am!" he was gawking off at a car that was parked a little ways down the road, he jumped a little, and I said "@CAPS10 did I scare you?" in an little school girl voice, and he replied "@CAPS5, of course not! A man does not get scared." I just rolled my eyes and him and said "I have something for you, but you have to close your eyes". He was apprehensive at first but he did as I @NUM1 had managed to sneak up behind him, and when she tapped him on the shoulder he turned, but he gave me a look of bafflement as he did. When they were face to face @PERSON1 shouted "@CAPS9 @CAPS13 @CAPS14!" and @CAPS3 nearly jumped to the moon. @PERSON1 and I were laughing @CAPS7 hard we nearly peed our brand new pants. @CAPS3 in confusion whipped his head between @PERSON1 and I, and said "@CAPS16 this is interesting" we continued laughing like buffoons, and @CAPS3 even giggled a little. He told us "@CAPS18't you two ever do this again!" and I said "@CAPS19! We basically are sisters @CAPS7 @CAPS23 not play the part?" he just glared at me in discontent and @PERSON1 rolled her eyes and said "@CAPS2? Did the man get scared?". We both cracked up again and @CAPS3 just smiled cause he knew we were playing around. @CAPS24 was just a blast after that, @PERSON1 and I continued to torment the town as twins. We ran around cars and into stores and had a stupendous time being absolute fools. We even got @CAPS3 to laugh hard enough to clutch his stomach. When @CAPS24 was time to @CAPS14, we ventured to the parking lot where @PERSON1's mother was going to pick us up, she did a triple take when she saw us, she just laughed at us when we got in and asked "@CAPS23 are you two wearing the same @NUM2 and I just looked at each other and busted out laughing, and we replied "@CAPS24's a long story". @CAPS24 was the perfect end to an amazing @CAPS1 being my best friend.
