@NUM1)I heard one true story about one normal @CAPS1 businessman. he wasn't that high levelin his company. @CAPS2 he always say hello to everyone in company with his big laugh.One day, the boss of company came to his company and asked everyone  who doingwork hardest?" @CAPS2 nobody didn't answer that question. then the boss said "or recommendsomeone for promote level" and then everyone recommended that business man. Becausehe always say hello to everyone with big laugh. and he goes to highest level in his company except the boss. what I'm trying to say is the laugh make people happier. and when i was with my friends,laugh was make us more friendly. also laugh is good for health too. If you laugh a lotyour life is getting way more longer than before. of course it is good for mind too.that business man wasn't very good worker. He just made everyone happier to his laugh.that's why he could be a highest level of the company.I think laugh is really good for everything. and I also laugh a lot. I want people make happier."
