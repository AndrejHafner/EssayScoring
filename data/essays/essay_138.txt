  When it comes down to laughter, it can change a person's thinking or even the mood that @CAPS4 are in. Laughter can be the ending result, to a bad start to a day or to greater the relationship between two people. I love to laugh because it shows how I am feeling and it keeps me happy, I not only laugh when I'm sad, but also when I'm in a great mood as well. Growing up in a world full of tragedies and war, I feel like you should always keep your head held high and the smiles flowing. Although, when life gives you lemons, you must make lemonade and keep your face with the sour look because it's funny! I think that laughter is one of the best medicines around and can fix most problems whenever you are feeling down.  @CAPS2 older sister brought into this world the most amazing little nieces, an aunt could ever have. When @CAPS4 were little babies I used make silly faces, dance to @PERSON1 and watch movies with them, but this isn't what brought us closer. It was the fact that I wanted to laugh, in which made them happy too. One time, I was feeling really down and out, but I didn't want that to affect me, so I preceeded with @CAPS2 day and began to watch music videos, when "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3", by @ORGANIZATION1 came on. @CAPS4 went crazy!, @CAPS4 started jumping on the bed and twirling their @CAPS3 back and forth as if @CAPS4 were @ORGANIZATION1!, @CAPS4 really stole the show. I couldn't believe before @CAPS2 eyes that this one happening, and I bursted out with so much joy. I felt so much of their joy, that I had to get up and dance with them, we jumped, we twirled, and whipped our @CAPS3 several times before the song ended with us dizzy and out of breath. After we had our fun of the music video, @CAPS4 just kept dancing and in @CAPS2 head I'm, like "don't @CAPS4 ever get tired", but I was pretty sure that their laughter brought them continouis amazement. A smile is worth a thousand words and laughter is priceless, @CAPS2 nieces really and are truly what brought me up that day. It was bitter in the start but then ended up sweet, lets just called it bittersweet. I feel like @CAPS2 nieces knew that I would be sad so @CAPS4 would say "@CAPS5, what's wrong", @CAPS5 being @CAPS2 nickname because I am very short. @CAPS4 would always find a way to make me feel the need to smile and have a good time. Me and @CAPS2 neices relationship has grown to the highest extent and I know that whenever I'm with them, I will laugh. If someone once said that "laughter is the shortest distance between two people", then @CAPS4 are correct because I @MONTH1 be in a different country, state or any other area but whether we talk on the phone or actually see each other, I will laugh about all their crazy antics and the closer we become as one.
