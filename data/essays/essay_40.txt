 Laughter and exuberance are key elements in any good relationship. Being able to be giddy and joyful with someone close to @CAPS11 is a sign of comfort. It often can bring people closer and help to solidify their friendships. Your true self is shown in your humor. Two years ago when I was in @PERSON1's seventh grade math class at @ORGANIZATION1, I was chosen to be in the @ORGANIZATION2 along with just three other classmates. Being in the @ORGANIZATION2 simply meant that we would be teaching ourselves @CAPS1-@CAPS2 using only textbooks, while @PERSON1 would teach the rest of the class an easier, more simple math. The @ORGANIZATION2 was almost like an elite club. Our other classmates looked upon us with jealousy because we got to sit in the back of the classroom together, never had to do any homework, and were never called upon out of the blue to answer questions in front of the whole class. Being the immature seventh graders that we were, we abused @TIME1 incredible opportunity that we had. I became fast friends with the three other people in the @ORGANIZATION2. Their names were @PERSON4, @PERSON3, and @CAPS3. @PERSON4 and I were already friends, but it was working together in the @ORGANIZATION2 that really brought us closer together. I also became close with @ORGANIZATION3 and @CAPS3. To @TIME1 day, @PERSON4 is one of my very best friends and I still keep in touch with the other two. We were all very different from each other. @PERSON3 was caught up in the popular crowd, @CAPS3 usually hung out with the really smart kids who were into chess and reading books, and @PERSON4 and I were just normal. However, we all had two important things in common; our sick sense of humor and our intelligence.  We each felt that the work we were teaching ourselves was much too easy. We breezed right through the book and never really had any questions. In doing @CAPS8, we always finished our assigned work quickly and had more than half of the class left to just sit there, eat, and goof off. That doesn't necessarily mean that that's the order things played out in. "@PERSON4, I don't feel like doing math @DATE2. I'm beat," I complained as we walked into @PERSON1's room for math right after lunch. "@CAPS6 neither," she replied. "I say we just sit there and make it look like we're doing work." We made our way to the table in the back where @CAPS3 and @PERSON3 were already sitting. They had their books, pencils, and spirals out, but sat there with vacant expressions. @PERSON4 and I joined them in sitting and we all exchanged disgruntled looks. "@CAPS8 uh, I was talking to @LOCATION1 @TIME1 and he said that we don't have to do any work @DATE2. We can just sit here and hang out," I lied, not even bothering to hide my smirk. Catching on, @CAPS3 and @PERSON3 grinned. @PERSON3 turned around and pulled a brown paper bag out of her backpack. She began to pull food out of the bag and offered it all up to us. I immediately grabbed the miniature chocolate pie. Midway through eating it, I dipped my finger in the gooey chocolate and wiped a big blob of it on the window behind @CAPS6. @PERSON4 noticed and immediately started to chuckle. "@CAPS10, what's that?!" she exclaimed, loud enough for everyone in the class to hear. @PERSON1 and a few classmates glanced over briefly, but got back to the lesson instantly. It really wasn't funny at all, but the four of us dissolved into giggles. "@CAPS11 guys, I had @TIME1 crazy dream @TIME2," @PERSON3 said as the laughter died down. "I went to @TIME1 @DATE1 camp thing, and @PERSON2 was one of the camp counselors. He was wearing khaki pants and a white shirt with blue pinstripes. Oh, and he also had a clipboard!" We stared at her blankly and then burst out laughing once more. The funny thing about @TIME1, was that @PERSON2 often substituted for our teachers, and he wore that exact outfit each time. But the even funnier thing was that it really wasn't funny at all. We were @CAPS8 desperate for a good time, we found chocolate blobs on windows and khaki pants to be hilarious. Our laughter died down and we sat there in silence. Suddenly, @CAPS3 leaned back in his squeaky swivel chair and it immediately broke, dropping him right to the ground. To anyone else, @TIME1 would have been funny. However, we each sat in silence, staring at one another. It wasn't that we were embarrassed for him or felt sympathy, but simply ironic that obsolete things sent us into fits of giggles, while a substantial, laughable event made us simply sit there. I don't think I'll ever forget the @ORGANIZATION2. Though it was a waste of time, we had many good laughs. We @MONTH1 not have learned a lot about math, but we learned a lot about each other.
