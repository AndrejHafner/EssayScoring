 Laughter, the sense of pure happiness. You are in the moment @CAPS1 nothing else matters, all your worries @CAPS1 stress fall away leaving you with your true happy self. Have you ever had those moments when everything seem too much? Then a friend says something that makes you laugh, once your done laughing you start to cry because it felt so good to laugh. Or when you laugh so hard you fall to the floor @CAPS1 can't get up for what seems hours? Yet looking back you forget what was so funny. Laughter is magical, @CAPS7 behind love. Those two seem to go hand in hand. When you love someone, not just you boyfriend/girlfriend but you friends @CAPS1 family too, you know how to make them laugh or cheer them up, how to have fun with them, @CAPS1 that brings you even closer together. When I'm with @CAPS16 friends the one thing we seem to do most is laugh. We laugh about anything @CAPS1 everything that is even slightly funny. It bring us closer together, sharing a moment of joy. The six of us are very close @CAPS1 will be friends after high @ORGANIZATION1 is over, even if we go to colleges a thousands of miles away. It is because we have shared so many happy memories. Laughter is important in a relationship. We trust each other @CAPS1 can share anything with them even our most important secrets. This story is how we came to be so close. Brightly colored fancy dresses @CAPS1 killer high heels were splayed out across the room. Open soda cans @CAPS1 chip bags. The faint smell of nail polish, flowery perfume, @CAPS1 deodorant lingering in the air. Laughter @CAPS1 giggles bubbling through out the room with the occasional squeal. Pitch black outside but light @CAPS1 warm in. Six of us lounging around the room. Smeared makeup @CAPS1 deflating hair. Sweat pants @CAPS1 baggy t-shirts. We all went from looking our very best to... not, within a few minutes. Yet not one of us cared. We when looking at each other we were able to @CAPS17 past appearances had fun with each other, not their looks. We had just gotten back from the @ORGANIZATION1. None of us had had dates but we still managed to have the time of our lives. "@CAPS1 did you see him! He was dancing with her!" "I wouldn't really call that dancing...." she made a pelvic thrust, we all burst into a new round of giggles @CAPS1 shouted stuff like, "@CAPS2, get a room!" We gossiped about what we saw, who was with who, pretty dresses, hot @CAPS4, creeper @CAPS4, slow dances, the music, even our @CAPS8 we hid our cups so we would know which one was ours when we wanted to use it again.We had all been friends, but recently we had been becoming closer. Starting to move from friends to best friends.  It was at least @NUM1 @CAPS3. Everyone was exhausted but was forcing themselves to stay up with caffeine @CAPS1 sugar. You @MONTH1 ask why, but I'm not really sure. Maybe because we always seem to have so much to talk about, because we enjoy each others company, or just because we can, so why not?"@CAPS4 I think we need a picture, a picture of the six of us." I said."@CAPS5!" "@CAPS6""@CAPS7 now? I'm a mess!""I've got just the thing!" @PERSON1 takes off running upstairs to grab something."@CAPS8 should we sit?""@CAPS9 the bed?""@CAPS10, @CAPS5! Scoot over fatties""@CAPS11! I'm not fat, I'm festively plump!" We all cracked up to the reference of @LOCATION1 as we stared to squeeze into a corner of the squishy full size bed. @PERSON1 @CAPS1 @PERSON1's mom arrive back into the room. @PERSON1 was carrying a old @ORGANIZATION2 camera that print out the picture immediately after you took it. She gave the camera to her mom @CAPS1 jumped @CAPS9 to the bed. We all squished together, barely enough room to breathe."One...Two...Three!" @CAPS12! the picture came out. "@CAPS13 take one more while the first is developing. Again, one... two... three!" @CAPS14! @CAPS12! "@CAPS15!!!" We all screamed in unison. The bed broke! we had broken the bed! We all sat there clinging to each other in total shock."@CAPS16 bed! You @CAPS4 are faaaaat..." @PERSON1 said while trying to contain a giggle. Suddenly we were in hysterics. Even @PERSON1's mom was laughing. We were one big throbbing pile of laughter. Only the corner of the bed had broken so we were all pulled down into that corner. Then someone started tickling, it was war. Every girl for themselves. It was a mass of bedsheets, wiggling fingers, bare feet, biting @CAPS1 a whole lot of laughing. "@CAPS17 the pictures have developed." The first one showed us sitting together smiling, but the second one was taken just as the bed broke. It showed the shock @CAPS9 our faces as we held onto each other for support. Not only did it bring us literally closer together but it started our amazing friendship.
