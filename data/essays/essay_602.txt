I have lived in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 almost my whole life, I went to pre @CAPS5 all the way up to @NUM1 grade. @CAPS7 was about half way into my @DATE1 when my mom had told me the "@CAPS3" news. Honey we are moving, i froze in shock i didn't know what to think, no we can't move. why she said, um maybe because im going into @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I don't want to go somewhere where i have no clue who anybody is. Don't worry my mom said you will make some friends. Where are we moving any wise i asked? Lebanon she answered me in a soft @CAPS1 voice. @CAPS6 i guess its not that far away from here. There you go she said @CAPS7 wont be that bad once we get there and get everything settled in and unpacked. Yeah @CAPS13 i still don't know anybody there, @CAPS6 your cousin @PERSON2 goes there and he is a junior so he could maybe drive you to @CAPS5 everyday if you wanted and introduce you to some people. Okay i said i was excited @CAPS13 i didn't want to move away from @CAPS8. We started to pack up our things, @CAPS7 took us about a week to get everything out of the old house into the new one. After the house was all packed and our things where out we started to clean. We cleaned from the up stares all the way down, head to toe that took us about two days tops to do. So in all total @CAPS7 took us about a week and two days to get everything packed, moved out, and cleaned. We said our @CAPS11 byes to our friends and family and where on our way. Its not like we will never see them again i said to my brothers. We finally pulled up to the house, @CAPS8 was so anxious to see what @CAPS7 looked like. My mom opened the doors go check @CAPS7 out she said, wow this place is amazing we love @CAPS7 the boys said. I told you that you guys would love @CAPS7. We went up stares and picked out our rooms. there was only four bedrooms so the two younger boys had to share. When we where all done with that we stared to unpack our stuff. I was so tired from doing everything that after i was done unpacking my room i went and took a nape on my bed. When i woke up i realized that i have not unpacked everything like i though i did, so i finished with that. @CAPS5 started in about a week i was so excited @CAPS13 nervous @TIME1 the same time to see what @CAPS7 would be like. Finally the day was here, honey wake up time for @CAPS5 mom said already @CAPS13... oh forget @CAPS7 i said im groin to @CAPS5 no matter what. I get out of bed brush my teeth, hair, do my make up and get dressed. "@CAPS9" "@CAPS9" @PERSON2 is here time to go. I rush down stares get my back pack and get in the car. @CAPS11 morning he said @CAPS11 morning, you excited for @CAPS5 he asked yeah kinda just a little nervous.Don t be i will introduce you to my girlfriend she is a fresh man also k sounds @CAPS11 i said. We pull into the @CAPS5 wow that's a a lot of kids i said yea there is @NUM2 freshman this year. We get out of the car and go inside. Lets go show you around to your classes alright i said. This is you first period @PERSON1 she teaches @CAPS12 arts. He shows me the rest of the six and sends me to class. I walk in @CAPS8 staring @TIME1 me, my sstomach turning into notes wanting to fall out of my stomach. Welcome @LOCATION1 just sit down i will be with you shortly the teacher says. She shows me where to sit ans introduces me to the class. Finally the class is over, @CAPS13 i still have to go to six more. This day feels like its going bye for ever, i walk to the rest of my classes wondering if they will not be that scary @CAPS13 no i was wrong. Most of the teachers made me introduce my self in the front of the class @CAPS7 was terrifying! I get on the bus can't wait to get @CAPS2. I walk threw the doors, how was your day, did you make friends, mom calm down i said to her sorry i just want to know. My day was @CAPS11, can i go take a shower now? Yeah just don't take long k. I get out and go lay on my bed awww time to go to sleep i though @CAPS13 no my brothers had to come bum rush me and tell me about there day. @CAPS7 was about @TIME1 okay i though time to go to bed.
