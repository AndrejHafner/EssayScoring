 My father is a stone cold mean man. About the only time he smiles is when hes has a beer or when hes with friends. Last @DATE1 we where at my grandparent's house for a family barbecue when we got a call from mt @CAPS3 cousin @PERSON1 she told us that my @CAPS1 was in my great aunts will, a few days earlier we had gotten a call saying that great aunt @PERSON2 had died. My grandpa thought he was going to be in the will but he wasn't. Two weeks latter my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and me went to @LOCATION2 for my great aunts funeral. When we got to @LOCATION2 we drove to the upper peninsula. It turns out that we where going to a island on lake @LOCATION3 called @LOCATION1 island. Then when we got to my @CAPS3 cousin @PERSON1's house she toke us through the will. My @CAPS1 got @NUM1 acres, @NUM2 acres of forest, @NUM3 acres meadow, and @NUM3 acres with a two bedroom house, barn, and smoke shed.
