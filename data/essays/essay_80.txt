          There are times I get along with others and times I don't. There also are times where I make others laugh until they cry. Like this one time me and my friends where walking to the store, I start pointing out the most random things. When I pointed out the @CAPS1 store, he started laughing so hard that he literally peed his pants. So we had to go back to his house so he could change into some clean cloth, and it took him @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes to get dressed. So I asked @CAPS6 he was doing in there, and he said. "I'm taking a pee." @CAPS2 I started laughing and rolling on the floor, and that's when it hit me why he was laughing so hard about me pointing out the @CAPS1 store. It was because the last time we had gone inside and there was a man talking about his son's football team which my friend and I was on at the time, was in the top ten. Guss @CAPS6 we really weren't. The man felt so afraid of @CAPS6 the lady he was talking to might think of him. So @CAPS5 gets up and says to us. "@CAPS4 you for letting me know that. I thought he was right for a second." @CAPS5 gives us a hug and the man gets up and says. "@CAPS6 about me? How come I don't get a hug." That when I started to laugh harder @CAPS2 heck. Good thing I did not have to go to the rest room.
