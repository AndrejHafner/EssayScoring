 Fourth period, freshman year was the highlight of my entire freshman year. @LOCATION1 was what most people called him, but I simply called him, @CAPS1. So I'll start off with the first semester of ninth grade with physical science, fourth period. I had the first term with my best friend, @PERSON1, @CAPS12 we got to choose our seats, so we sat next to each other in the back, right hand corner of the classroom. We sat there so we could get away with more, like passing notes @CAPS12 talking during class. So one day, while we were passing the notebook of notes, I most have written something that embarrassed her. So I went to grab something out of my backpack, @CAPS12 she took advantage of the situation. So next thing I knew, I was being shoved out of my desk, onto my backpack, on my back. The class got quiet, for he was giving us notes @CAPS12 showing us how to do the assignment. So as we erupted into fits o laughter, I looked at him to see if he was very angry @CAPS12 if he was going to send us outside of the classroom to talk to us. But all @CAPS1 did was look at us, shake his head, laugh a little to himself, @CAPS12 begin talking again. So, we kept laughing, but we were trying to settle down @CAPS12 stop ourselves from laughing. In the second term, @PERSON1 was @CAPS10 in there with me, but I had my friend @CAPS3-@CAPS4, @CAPS5.@CAPS5, @CAPS12 @PERSON2. i was even closer to @CAPS1 then in the first term. So, one day he was teaching us about compounds. So while he was writing down a chart to help us study, he sang out, "@CAPS7 play the @CAPS8 @CAPS9!" @CAPS10 even seconds later, the class burst with laughter, even he had to stop from writing he was laughing so hard. It took us about ten minutes to settle down @CAPS12 stop laughing. Another part of the second term that was a fun @CAPS12 a good laugh was doing some example problems on our own. So one of my classmates, @LOCATION2, asked what should we do to tell him we are finished with the problems. So @LOCATION1 thought for a few moments, @CAPS12 said, "@CAPS11 you finish your problems, cluck like a chicken for me." @CAPS12 about five minutes afterwords, people started clucking like chickens. @CAPS12 with that, my friends brought up the fact that I own chickens. But as more people were finishing their problems, it was getting annoying. It was hilarious at first though. Then there was @CAPS13 @CAPS14. We had just a regular classroom, @CAPS10 a science @CAPS13, so we were unable to do to many experiments. So @CAPS15, the other science teacher let us borrow her classroom for an entire school @CAPS14, being as her class had an online report to do. @CAPS1 banned me from using the matches, because his nickname for me was @CAPS16-@CAPS17. Then on the final day, he broke about @NUM1 to a dozen glass test tubes. @CAPS11 this happened, i was almost complete with my packet we had to do for the @CAPS14. So I went over to him while he was cleaning up, @CAPS12 I asked what happened. He told me, my classmate broke a bunch of glass test tubes by dropping them. But he looked at me @CAPS11 he did so. So @CAPS11 I looked at him, he started laughing. Which gave his cover away, so i got after him @CAPS12 told him @CAPS10 to blame the children for things he did. especially for breaking the test tubes. There was also the one time I went into his @CAPS18 class to do some homework. My friend wanted me to be there for one day, because she lvoed the class so much. So my guitar lessons teacher allowed me to spend fifth period in that class. So, @CAPS11 he was done giving notes @CAPS12 giving the class their assignment for the day. Some friends of @CAPS3 @CAPS19 called him over for a question. So I looked up from my drawing. By then he was already over to them. So they asked him if he was a swimmer, he replied he did swim. So then they asked if he shaved his legs because he was a swimmer. I think he got embaressed, so he said to come after class @CAPS12 ask personal questions. So they just wanted a yes or no, so he explained, for about five minutes, that they shouldn't waste classtime for silly @CAPS12 personal question about him. I thought the entire time, "@CAPS20 doesn't he just say yes or no?" @CAPS21 were fun times that I will never forget @CAPS12 tell the day I die. No class, or science class will ever replace fourth period physical science. Nor any teacher replace @LOCATION1, he is @CAPS12 always will be my favorite teacher. I will forever remember the days of every phsycial science class, because of that one simple teacher.
