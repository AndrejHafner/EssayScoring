A few years ago me, my mom and my sister @PERSON1 were at a sub shop for dinner. Whal we were in line waighting for our sandwiches, @PERSON1 who was severl inches shoter than me at the time, said that she was taller than me, so I stratend up and said that I was still taller. Then she stoud up on her tip-toes (making her taller than me) and said that she was too taller than me and she stuck her toung out at me, so I stoud up on my tip-toes (makimg me taller) and stuck out my toung at her. The funny part is that there was this cute guy standing behind @LOCATION1 so it looked like I was sticking my toung out at him! He had this amused look on his face like he was looking at some cute little kid. I quickly stuck my toung back in my mouth and returned to my normal hight. I then tolled my mom that @PERSON1 were going to find a place to sit. Once we found a place to sit I toled her abought the guy standing behind her and we both laughed it was really funny and we still joke about it! : )
