 My smile is a mask. It disguises all the past trageties, future mishaps, and current mistakes--loss. Life is a puzzle i can not figure out. I am lost, and I am losing myself the more I pounce into life. Isolate myself from the world, sleep in a bed of tear soaked tissues, and stare at my face in the mirror that I despise so much. Laughter or even just a smile goes a long way--to long. It sends the wrong message to those who can not tell if the mask is real, or perfectively put on. That is the message I want to give, right? Pretty soon, my laughter diminishes, my smile lowers, and my lips began to quiver. It feels as though my heart is bleeding, and being squeezed at the same time. The eyes are becoming moist, they began to sting, and reden as if infected. Do not ask me if I am okay, ask to do anything for me, or hug me. Only pushing me to breakdown, which is something that is unexceptable. Peace, is the only thing needed at the moment; and of course, my best friend, tissue.
