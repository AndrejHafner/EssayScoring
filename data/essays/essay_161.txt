  The comfort of a laugh. Many different kinds of comfort can come from a laugh. My story is the comfort of love. @CAPS6 i was a young and foolish teen. (@CAPS1 wait that's what i would still be today.) A few days ago my friend @CAPS2 had me laughing so hard, and all because @CAPS5 slipped up while meeting my mother. (@CAPS2 was nerves to meet my mother.) For some reason @CAPS6 i started to laugh @CAPS5 suddenly began to act as if every thing was fine, and that there was nothing to be nerves about.  @CAPS7 latter @CAPS6 we went for our walk i asked him about it. I simply said "@CAPS4 did your mood change @CAPS6 i began to laugh?" @CAPS5 smiled and replied "@CAPS6 you laugh i feel calm and know that i am going to be alright." @CAPS7 myself being a typical teen girl i blushed, @CAPS7 quickly changed topics, while trying not to make eye contact. Suddenly i could not help my self. The feeling of his eyes on my cheek was over powering my will to not look. Turning my head slowly, sure enough there @CAPS5 was starring straight back in to my eyes, his eyes were wonderful they reminded me of sunflowers with a blue sky behind them. As @CAPS5 stared back i got a feeling as if @CAPS5 were trying to unlock all that i am, and all that i know with his eyes. As if @CAPS5 could see straight to my soul. Quickly I turned away. With a soft and almost beautiful voice @CAPS5 let a little laugh out. This laugh was as sweet to my ears, as nectar is to a hummingbird.  The next few days where hard. All i could think about was that walk. People must have thought i was crazy, every time i would remember the walk, each time i would remember his laugh. @CAPS7 let a laugh of my own out. @CAPS7 i realized that laughter plays a big role in every ones life. For me i laugh @CAPS6 I'm with the people i love. For some its watching t.v. that they find amusing, or maybe there kids did some thing rather silly. So silly you had to tell your book club. The point is that laughter is every where.  Laughter is never a bad thing in fact it has been proven that laughter has a lot of health benefits. Some people don't get it. Laughter is not some thing to be ashamed of ether, if some one laughs at you just laugh with them. Its not laughter that starts wars. its not laughter that kills people. its people who chose not to fill there lives with the joy of laughter.  So here is the goal. laughter can also be very contagious. So try and @CAPS8 a laugh on. Do some thing that @CAPS6 people remember it they will start there own laughs. Laughter-@CAPS8 it on!
