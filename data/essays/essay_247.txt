I was about ten when this story happened to me. I was with my grandma when the story happened. We were at the park and I put my head in the monkey bars. My grandma had went to the bathroom and I was stick in the monkey bars.The kids at the park thought it was funny and were laughing at me. I was really embarrassed.When I got my head out of the monkey bars I told the kids that they should try putting there head in the monkey bars. The other kids tried doing it and they all got there heads stuck in the monkey bars. The kid did not know that I had practiced putting my head in the monkey bars so that it would not get stuck. I was laughing very hard at what I had just done and when my grandma came out I asked if we could go home. The next day we went back to the park and I got some different kids with the same trick. What I don't get is if my head was stuck why would they try the same thing. The kids this time told there mom and dad what I did and they told my grandma and I got in a lot of trouble.We went home and I was grounded for about two weeks. The next time I went to the park I did the same thing. That shows that kids will be kids.
