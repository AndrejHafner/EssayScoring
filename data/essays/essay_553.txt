We all need laughter once in our life!, but why do we need it? or why is it important to us?. We need laughter to have a great time with our friends and family because with out laughter our life's would be black and white we would be empty from inside with no spark of happiness and we would be grumpy all the time. Laughter is also important to us because that also gets us as people be in a relationship with someone we really like it maybe a female or a male it's also important that in the relationship you also have a great time when you are with that special person and not be bored and talk about things that really don't matter when you are with that person. Its fun when you make someone laugh because that shows that @CAPS6 are having a great time with you and might want to hang out some other day again and that's why we need laughter in a relationship or in friendships. Once I use to live in @LOCATION3 till my parents decided to move to @PERSON2.@CAPS5 my parents told me I was going to go to @LOCATION1 I knew a few people from this @LOCATION1.The people I knew were @NUM1,and @PERSON1 but I didnt really talk with @LOCATION2 or @CAPS1 before I only talked with @PERSON1. On my first day of @LOCATION1 he presented @CAPS2 friends to me because I didn't really know anybody else besides them three he would make up any kind of jokes and would involve me in it so I would be able to meet this friends better and maybe be friends with them but laughter always make friends and boy friends because I started dating when I was in middle @LOCATION1 I dated three guys my third boyfriend was the best he was sweet and nice he would do @CAPS3 ever just to make me laugh we only dated for @NUM2 years but @CAPS5 there was too much drama that I broke up with him it was really hard because I really liked him but we would still talk and make fun of each other he would still be nice to me even if we were not together like he wanted and me to but just because of the drama we had we broke up.always laugh dont get down just because of a relationship smile and laugh.After a year with out dating he decided to ask me if I wanted to be @CAPS2 girlfriend again and I thought about it a lot because I didn't want to go through the same drama as before.While we were not dating he would always find away to make me laugh or smile. when he sees me down @CAPS2 always there for me to support me and make me laugh that's @CAPS3 I like about him that @CAPS2 sweet and nice but if he only didn't believe @CAPS3 @CAPS2 friends tell him we would still be together and we would be laughing at everything together. We would make fun of each other we would never stop laughing it was some great times when I was with him but he still try's to keep a smile on my face even if I'm mad sad or not in the mood of doing something that's why we need laughter in our life's because it brings joy to does people that love us and care for us and by us having a smile in our face @CAPS6 are happy. Always make a relationship good by having a good time and making each other laugh one way or another it doesn't matter of @CAPS3 you laugh the thing is that you have fun.  Another way to have fun and enjoy your relationship and friends at the same time is to have a time and maybe go to the movies with all your friends and boyfriend and go watch a movie or go to the fair were ever you think you want to go but also think about your friends and boyfriend if @CAPS6 are going to have fun there or if @CAPS6 will get bored. When you go with them make sure you make them laugh at least so @CAPS6 know that you are having fun make up a joke but don't say a joke that will make them fall asleep like my little sister @CAPS4 told us a joke it goes like this (guy on the @NUM3 I speak to your dad?" the little boy whisper and said "@CAPS2 busy!","@CAPS3 about your mom?" said the man on the phone, @CAPS5 the kid said "@CAPS4 is busy too!" @CAPS5 the man asked him "@CAPS5 @CAPS3 are @CAPS6 doing?" and the boy says"@CAPS6 are looking for me!" we didn't get it at first @CAPS5 my sister told us that the boy was hiding from @CAPS2 parents because he took the phone with him as in the boy don't tell jokes like does make it more funner. and thats why we need laughter in our life's.
