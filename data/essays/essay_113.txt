 Seeing one of @CAPS15 best friends trip and hit his face on a screen door, was enough to make myself laugh. Its was the @DATE1 after @CAPS15 @NUM1 grade year of school. I was having @CAPS15 friends @PERSON2, @PERSON3 and @CAPS15 neighbor @PERSON1 stay the night at @CAPS15 house. @CAPS25 ever we got bored we usually went around @CAPS15 neighborhood "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3" some houses to have some fun. "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3" is @CAPS25 @CAPS21 quietly sneak up to someones front door, ring the door bell a couple times and then @CAPS23 run away. All four of us were hanging out that day. It was a great @DATE1 day, gorgeous sun, warm temperature and a nice gentle breeze to cool off your face.@CAPS25 it came to night fall we were all in @CAPS15 room playing @CAPS7 @NUM2.  "I'm bored bro," @PERSON2 said to the other three of us.  "@CAPS8 then, think of something to @CAPS19,"@CAPS9 replied  "I can't think of anything," @PERSON1 stated with a bored look on his face. We sat for a while thinking of something to @CAPS19 to entertain the four of us. "I got it!" I said with a confident smirk ,"lets go @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!" " I down for that ,"@PERSON2 said "@CAPS13 me too ,"@CAPS9 and @PERSON1 replied shortly after @PERSON2. As we were walking out @CAPS15 front door @CAPS15 mom shouted ,"where are @CAPS21 boys going?" @CAPS15 mom caught me off guard. I didn't know what to say ,"uh, we are going on a walk ,"I replied hesitantly.  "@CAPS16 be safe," @CAPS15 mom said as I walked out of the door. We @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ditched a couple house, but that was starting to get boring and then it hit me like a typhoon. I came up with the best idea I have thought of yet.  "@CAPS18 this is what needs to happen, I'm going to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS28 the first house, @PERSON2 @CAPS21 get the next one, @PERSON1 @CAPS21 get the house at the corner and @PERSON3 will run around the corner to get the last house.   "@CAPS19 @CAPS21 think that will work?" @PERSON1 asked.  "@CAPS20 yes it will work!" I said,"@CAPS21 @CAPS18 ready?"   "I guess so ," @PERSON1 replied shortly after @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 yes. We all lined up in place. I rang the first door bell and started running, then I saw @PERSON2 slam his clinched fist on the second door, next i didn't see @PERSON1 ring the door bell because he was already running ahead of me.  "@CAPS9 get the last house!" I shouted at him. The house @CAPS9 was running to did not have their porch light on. @CAPS9 was running fast to the house and failed the see the step up in front of the door. I didn't expect what happened next. SMACK! @CAPS9 tripped over the step up and hit his face on the screen door. I could hear the slam from the middle of the dark street.  He got up quickly and turn to us in confusion ,"should I ring the door bell? Should I ring it?"  "@CAPS23 run @CAPS9 I'm sure they would hear @CAPS21 smack their screen door with your face!" @CAPS25 we got back to @CAPS15 house everyone was laughing. @CAPS9 @CAPS23 made our night. That happened @NUM3 years ago and I still remember it like it happened yesterday. So next time one of your friends ask @CAPS21 to "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS28" a house think about if the porch lights are on.
