 Day after day, people laugh. For many different reasons, only those who are laughing @MONTH1 know.There have been times in everyone's lives, where they just need to laugh. Maybe because we are upset, or to make a situation more comfortable, to get to know someone better, even to just get a conversation started. I was @NUM1 years old, I was finally hired for a job. I am now an employee for @ORGANIZATION1. Being the youngest guy @CAPS1 the crew, I had to make an impression. I didn't know @CAPS11 to do. My first few days were awkward and silent.I was so nervous, i kept thinking to myself " @CAPS11 am I doing, I don't belong here. I don't know anyone, don't knowwhat i am doing." @CAPS1 one of the hottest days of the year, we had finished our work for the day and everyone @CAPS1 the crewwas going to the river. I wasn't planning @CAPS1 going, until @CAPS2, one of the guys that i will also be going to school with came up to me and said " hey @CAPS3 @CAPS21 need a ride to the river?" and @CAPS6 laughed. " @CAPS4 could @CAPS21 give me a ride to my house to grab a pair of shorts?" I replied.  " @CAPS5 I'll lend @CAPS21 a pair." @CAPS6 said. " I don't think @CAPS21'll have a pair that will fit my fat ass." I replied. " @CAPS7 @CAPS7 @CAPS17 i do lets go." @CAPS6 said @CAPS2, and I walked over to his truck and went to his house. I noticed something as soon as I got into his truck, a bottle with @CAPS11 I thought was coffee in it. I asked him. " @CAPS10 do @CAPS21 need coffee in the morning?" I said " @CAPS11 are @CAPS21 talking about?" @CAPS6 replied " The bottle." I said " @CAPS7 @CAPS7 @CAPS21 dumb ass, that's not coffee that chew spit." @CAPS6 repliedI just left it at that. We got to his house, walked in through the garage, and there was the cutest dog i had ever seen,her name was @ORGANIZATION3. She followed us though the house, and @CAPS6 gave me the tour. Then handed me a pair of shorts and we went @CAPS1 our way. We all met back up at work, and went from there. This being my first time going to the river with them, I saw so much of the property that i had never seen before. We went past our hay barn and down a gravel road. to this gate, which led to the river. I had never seen the gate, I'm riding in the bed of @CAPS2's truck, bouncing around. The road has so many ruts. Once we reach the river,everyone starts changing. My bosses daughter is there and our crew leader's girlfriend. And I glance over at them once there dressedand my crew leader, @PERSON1, looks at me and says "@CAPS16". and so I turn around and @CAPS6's tossing the cooler at me. I try and @CAPS16 the cooler but it throws me to my butt. Everyone starts laughing even I do, @CAPS6 comes over and helps me up and says, " that's for looking at my cousin and girlfriend."" @CAPS17 I looked, hell i aint got no chance of hooking up with them anyway" I replied. Everyone laughed, and that's how we started out day at the river. In a great mood. We sit around and listen to music talking and having fun.Then @CAPS2 and @PERSON1, start floating down the river. So we all go, all of us trying to @CAPS16 up. We finally do all of us are sore from the rocks @CAPS1 our rears. There is this log I see, sitting in the river. I climb to the top, and try a back flip. Only to show off of course. some how @CAPS19 perfectly in the river. All of us start jumping off and having a good old time.   It starts to get dark, and we get to the bank, start walking back. everyone going a different way because we all know the best way back.we all finally make it back. And go up to @CAPS6 house, once we reach the house, they decide we're going out to eat. Once we get to @ORGANIZATION2 all order, @PERSON1 says to me " @CAPS20 o, @CAPS21 know we were all kinda worried about @CAPS21, @CAPS21 never spoke." " I had nothing to say" I replied." @CAPS21 know, your gonna get yourself in trouble checking out a guys family and girl". @CAPS6 said." I know, but i cant help it". I replied. I looked over at his cousin and winked." @CAPS21 have some balls, but I'm glad @CAPS21 @CAPS1 the crew". @CAPS6 said. That's when I knew, I was finally welcomed. That night I stayed at @CAPS2's, and we just sat up watching @CAPS24 and joking back and forth.Now after looking back, I see that a good sense of humor can go a long ways. creates a good relationship. Now to me @CAPS2 is an olderto me.
