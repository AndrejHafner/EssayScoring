 People say laughter is the shortest distance between two people. A @ORGANIZATION1 I saw @CAPS6 to be true was when I met a girl named @PERSON1. Three years ago I was at a city @CAPS10 swinging, wondering if it would hurt if I jumped. I took @CAPS15 chances and let go of the swing chains, flying through the air , noticing the unbalanced feeling of falling in @CAPS15 chest, everything slowing down, the temptation of what will happen when I hit the ground was vast. Sticking the landing was a fail and getting up from it wasn't much of a success either, until I felt hands upon @CAPS15 shoulder and arm. I looked up at @CAPS15 helper and saw a girl. Not @CAPS5 a girl but a gorgeous girl. A girl with green dazzling eyes that can stop an angry rhino charging toward her, hair the flowed with the wind, soft, gentle skin that would make you think that @CAPS11 could be hurt for how soft it was."@CAPS1." Was all I could squeeze out."@CAPS1, are you okay?" @CAPS3 asked with a very concerned tone."@CAPS4 I'm fine, @CAPS5 forgot to stick the landing. Thanks for helping me, um whats your name?" I returned with a @NUM1, and your welcome. whats your name?" @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 giggled before @CAPS3 said her name."@CAPS7, do you want to walk around with me?" I struggled to vocalize."@CAPS8, but I have to @CAPS9 at the @CAPS10 because @CAPS15 mom will be here soon." @PERSON1 stated. during the walk around the @CAPS10 we stopped at a monkey dome and started asking each other random question's that the other person had to answer. I figured out that @CAPS3 was @NUM2 years old, her favorite color was baby blue and @CAPS3 always wanted to be a doctor. we walked around the playground some more @CAPS5 talking about past memories or something that happened to each other in the past. I asked her if @CAPS3 had a brother and sister. her response was that @CAPS3 does have a brother, and two sisters. While I was listening to her I noticed @CAPS3 was very deep into thought and asked what @CAPS3 was thinking about and @CAPS3 quickly replied. "@CAPS11, @CAPS5 wondering why I'm so happy with you.""well it could be that I'm making you feel good by laughter. Or it could be @CAPS15 charms working on you." I replied with a @CAPS12 accent."@CAPS13 @CAPS4 its definitely that." @CAPS3 barely got out the words cause of laughter. Suddenly there was a car horn honking and we said our goodbye's and @CAPS3 left. I sat there watching the car go down the road and was hoping that we @MONTH1 see each other again, but in a way I knew we wouldnt because @CAPS15 mom, and I were moving from the city to a small town half way across the country. Turning around and walking back toward @CAPS15 house for the last night in the city all I could think about was her and how a little bit of laughter became the @CAPS16 to friendship.
