 The bus flew around tightly wound corners. Beyond the windows, farmland, rocky bluffs, and peaceful rivers streamed past. Exhausted from the fourteen hour flight, I barely knew what time it was. The only things keeping me awake were the jolting of the bus and @NUM1 other @CAPS1 I barely knew gossiping quietly. We were going to visit and live with a group high school students, affectionately referred to as "our @CAPS2." I had met @CAPS16 partner, @LOCATION1, only once. Everything I knew about her, her life, her family I learned from maybe ten, maybe @NUM2 short @CAPS3 messages. Communication was going to be problematic. @CAPS16 mother started teaching me @CAPS4 when I turned two, but I was nowhere near fluent; I was self-conscience and uncomfortable around native speakers. @PERSON1's @CAPS5 was decent, but her family spoke only @CAPS4. Finally, the bus drove down the narrow cobbled streets of @CAPS7. It pulled up to a plaza packed with people. The doors hissed open, and we filed out into the crowd, standing on tiptoes to search for our new families. All around me, people chattered in a mix of @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. @PERSON1 and her parents waited somewhere in the middle, and I slowly wove @CAPS16 way towards them. Brigitte, @CAPS16 host mother, grabbed me in a hug. "@CAPS10 gehts? @CAPS10 war dein @PERSON2? How @CAPS18 you? How was your flight?"  @CAPS11 of @CAPS16 @CAPS4, I faltered, "@CAPS13 @PERSON2 war sehr langalso ich bin ein bisschen muede. The flight was very long, so I'm a little tired." @PERSON1 took @CAPS16 arm and led me uphill towards the school, where our welcome dinner was being held. She explained, "@CAPS14 is very excited to meet you. @CAPS7 is so small; we never get tourists. We only get @CAPS15 exchange students every other year." @CAPS16 stomach was filled with that jittery-sick feeling of nervous anticipation. Normally, making friends was easy for me, but this time was different. I only minimally understood the language and culture of the people surrounding me. The long flight was evident in the sleepless bags under @CAPS16 eyes and @CAPS16 greasy, knotted hair. @CAPS16 jet-lagged brain wondered how I would get along with these people. Would I fit in, be able to slip into @CAPS4 life without many hitches or snags? We passed from the antiquated street to a dusky tunnel-like entryway. After a few turns, we emerged into an open courtyard. An array of food covered several tables, and the scent of grilling bratwurst wafted through the air. "@CAPS18 you hungry? You should have something to eat. We have so much food here," @PERSON1 told me. I grabbed a plate and placed a roll, strawberries, and a sausage on it; I was too anxious to really be hungry. @PERSON1 steered me towards a worn table with wooden benches, where her friends were already enjoying dinner and a few beers. She introduced me, and I perched stiffly on the edge of the seat. @CAPS14 talked excitedly, questioning me about @CAPS15 life. As @CAPS14 loosened up, they began to joke, sometimes in @CAPS4, sometimes in @CAPS5. Some of the @CAPS2 teased me about @CAPS16 accent. It wasn't a mean teasing; they weren't trying to be malicious, just light and funny. So I laughed. In that moment, I seemed to fit better with these people I only sometimes understood. I was less a foreigner and more a new friend. Relaxing, I allowed myself to laugh at @CAPS16 mistakes and really enjoy being someplace entirely new.
