 Emotions are an essential part of life. Some emotions bring tears and laughter, which alone are two powerful and essential things to life. There was a time not too long ago that I was able to turn a girl's tears to laughter and made her day a little better.It all starts with the craze of today's teenage world, "@CAPS1". Which to those who don't know, it is a website where teens spend quite a lot of time on, and people can comunicate through this website. I log in and see that this girl I like is also signed in, so I start talking to her. The normal teenage conversation of, "@CAPS2, whats up?" that sort of thing happens, and then she asks if I am able to hang out. Now, tell me if I'm wrong, but most guys would go hang out if its a girl they like. I went to meet up with her at the library and as always, she was beautiful, even though I doubt she was trying. As I got closer to her, she seemed upset, yet when I asked what was bothering her, she did not wish to tell me. I didn't want to make things worse, so I left it alone. All I could thing about was what could I do to make her happy, so I started talking about the craziest things, not knowing if it would help or not. To my luck, it actually helped, and she started smiling. After a little while, I had her laughing and having a good time. Since that day, we have been dating, and are really happy, and everyday when I see her I say something random to make her smile.
