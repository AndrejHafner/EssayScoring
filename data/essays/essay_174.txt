                             Living, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter     @CAPS4 to this @DATE1 I don't remember exactly why I was laughing. All I can remember, vividly, in my mind is the look on my grandfathers face. He had on the same smile he always wore during times of joy. It was a wide warm grin he would shine your way every so often. As I laughed uncontrollably that @DATE1, so many years ago, he shined his happiness @CAPS1 love down on me for so long that I will never forget a single wrinkle in his grin. My @CAPS16, who we all called @CAPS5, had a way of keeping the peace @CAPS1 happiness in everything. No matter how bad things were within our family, he would always make things right. No one could get angry @CAPS3 @CAPS5, @CAPS1 no one could stay sad when he smiled. That's just the kind of guy he was. @CAPS5 was a big part of our family gatherings, just like the one we had on my @DATE1 @DATE1 @CAPS3 @CAPS5. That @DATE1 was our family's @DATE1 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 @CAPS5, soon after, he passed away. When I look back @CAPS1 realize how important that @DATE1 was I can see that it was a perfect @CAPS8 for everyone. It was a happy @DATE1 @CAPS1 my @DATE1 memories of my @CAPS16 were of his great big happy grin shining down on me while I giggled away during a card game.     When that @CAPS8 kicked off, in the early morning, the weather was already proving to be spectacular. Every one in my family was in high spirits @CAPS1 was ready to enjoy the @DATE1 @CAPS3 family. My favorite activity during each @CAPS1 every family event is to play my favorite games @CAPS3 everyone. Our family has a few specific games that are a tradition during family gatherings. One of our favorites is called @CAPS12-@CAPS13. Now @CAPS12-@CAPS13 was one of the many games that my @CAPS16 was very good at playing. He rarely ever lost a game, @CAPS1 would not finish playing until he had won at least once. So when everyone was assembled at our house, I convinced @CAPS5 @CAPS1 my cousin @PERSON1 to play @CAPS12-@CAPS13 @CAPS3 me. We went into the spare room @CAPS1 starting dealing out the cards. About a half an hour later we were still playing, @CAPS1 to no ones surprise, @CAPS5 was winning. It was just before the food was ready @CAPS1 we were about halfway through the game when either my cousin @PERSON1, or @CAPS5 said something to me that I thought was the funniest thing my tiny @NUM1 year old ears had ever heard, @CAPS1 I began to laugh.     My family was so thoroughly entertained @CAPS3 my laughter that they could not keep their smiles @CAPS1 laughter tucked away without bursting into giggles as bad as mine. It seemed that my senseless laughing created instant joy to my family, including my @CAPS16. @CAPS5' smile was one of the greatest things my little eyes looked up at during my childhood. It was something so imaginary, yet so colorful @CAPS1 vivid in front of me,that I would worship his smile like I was seeing my first solar eclipse. I never quite understood, at such a young age what was so fascinating about his smile, but now I do understand. @CAPS5' smile showed true, wholesome, unbreakable joy. His smile didn't come out all too often so when it did, you knew something good was happening.    No one knew that was our @DATE1 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 @CAPS5. I most certainly could not imagine it to be the @DATE1 I would spend @CAPS3 my @CAPS16. Everything was so perfect @CAPS1 so increasingly happy, it seemed to be a crime to end his life during such a time of joy. Although if I were him, @CAPS1 if I had to choose my @DATE1 @CAPS8, that @DATE1 would be perfect. My single memory of that @DATE1 was laughing, @CAPS1 being happy. I can't think of any better way to spend my @DATE1 bit a time @CAPS3 @CAPS5 then a @DATE1 where we were both completely satisfied in our card game, laughter, @CAPS1 smiles.    Laughter is a funny thing. It is unique in every person, @CAPS1 can range from any kind of humor to pure happiness. Laughter brings hope in times of doubt @CAPS1 never fails to make someone smile. Someone, somewhere started a quote that says, "@CAPS25. Laugh. Love." I believe those three words can combine together, @CAPS1 act separately to sum up a perfect life for anyone willing to @CAPS25 out the true, meaningful definition of each of those words. Laughter brings smiles of happiness, humor, @CAPS1 love. Love brings us all together, @CAPS1 when we strive to be happy @CAPS1 to love, that is when we can truly @CAPS25. My grandfather loved each @CAPS1 every one of his family @CAPS1 friends @CAPS1 made a priority of keeping them happy. He lived his life the best way that I believe anyone could ever @CAPS25 it. He died after a life full of love happiness @CAPS1, most importantly, the very special gift of laughter.
