                          A funny Story  Many summers ago, @CAPS1 best friend @PERSON1 and I had a sleepover at @CAPS1 house. We were both excited because @CAPS1 dad would be the only one there. @CAPS1 mom and brother were out late. After eating popcorn and getting stuffed up on candy, we decided to try something new and fun. @CAPS1 house has a counter bar where four to five people can sit at and so @CAPS1 daddy decided to turn on some hip hop music. As though @PERSON1 and I could read each others minds we jumped on the counter and started doing the run way model walk. We worked it like no other. It was funny to see @CAPS1 dad pretending to be the fake photographer and say that's "gorgeous" as though he was a real photographer. @PERSON1 and I strutted up and down and did stops and poses and turns, until we got too dizzy. We all knew we could never do this with @CAPS1 mom @ORGANIZATION1 which made everything so funny! We all bursted out laughing until we couldn't breath! Later on after that fun model runway we decided to pillow surf down the stairs. I was a little afraid to at first but after I saw the look on @PERSON1's face, I knew I had to do it. I grabbed a big body pillow and surfed down those stairs like a champ! It was such a blast! @PERSON1 and I kept pillow @CAPS2 for what seems forever! @CAPS1 dad put on @ORGANIZATION1 and we laughed the rest of the night away. That night was one of the best and @ORGANIZATION1 memories of @CAPS1 childhood.
