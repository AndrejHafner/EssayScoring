                                 @CAPS2 @CAPS1      The first time i ever heard about the sport @CAPS2 @CAPS1 was the beginning of my freshman year. I was interested in doing it but i wasn't really sure about it. Though during eighth grade i had played volleyball just for the fun of it and really enjoyed it. I had decided i wanted to play volleyball once i got into high school. But when i got into high school my opinion of still playing on the high school volleyball team changed. I realized it was much more then i expected, the people, and the attitudes i realized that if i were to play on the high school volleyball team i wouldn't have any fun. So i started to look into joining the @CAPS2 @CAPS1 team. I had finally decided to sign up and join the team. I had really hope i would like @CAPS2 @CAPS1 because it was my first year on the team and i had absolutely no idea what to expect of it.          The first day of practice, after school i went into the girls locker room, changed and took everything with me and went out to the track shed. When i got out there, i saw a lot of people i had never seen before, except for the kids in my grade and also my best friend. My coach @PERSON1 started to talk to everyone that was new to @CAPS2 @CAPS1. She told us that it would be a great experience and it was a a great sport and also it was more of a individual sport rather than a team sport. But also we did many things as a team. After she had talked and discussed the basics of @CAPS2 @CAPS1. We we're to jog our warm up lap and then stretch as a team. Then we were to start our run for the day and everyday was a different work out either a road run or a track work out. I began to really enjoy @CAPS2 @CAPS1. At first, i was beyond sore and couldn't move at all. But as the season started to really get going i eventually got into shape and looked forward to practice after school every day. We trained and got ready for my first race which made me very nervous i had no idea what to expect my first race ever and i was so scared and nervous. But after, i had ran my first race ever i felt good and was proud of myself. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is something i have always loved every since my freshman year when i first started to run.      One of my most favorite races we've ever done was called "@CAPS5 @CAPS6" the first time i ever ran in that race was my freshman year, it was like of our third or fourth races of the season. It also happen to be the first time we had done that race in over a couple years. So i was excited for it because i had heard about it and everyone was telling me how exciting it was going to be and that i would love it, the day of the race i was once again nervous like every other race I've been too and still am every since i first joined @CAPS2 @CAPS1. When we arrived at the destination we set up a tent, started to warm up for the each of the races that was going to happen a boys race and a girls race. We also went over the course and that's when i realized what everyone was telling me the mud pits and a huge steep hill and we had to @CAPS2 a river twice. After the race, i had such a great time my team and i laughed and we all enjoyed ourselves. It was so much fun, our bus rides as a team, all the fun practices. As a team we enjoyed many laughs and all the fun times we've had together. My favorite year of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 would have to be my freshman year because it was my best season, i loved it. We grew to love each other and bonded as a team. Laughter was a big part of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 we laughed and enjoyed each others company as we practices and also as we were on bus rides on the way to our meets. We had a lot of fun, and laughed often as a team and that to me was a big part of getting to know my team and being able to bond and build relationships and friendships with everybody on my team. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is a sport where laughter is a big part of running and having fun and enjoying everyone's company, without laughter our team would not be as happy,excited, or even ready to practice. Laughter is big in @CAPS2 @CAPS1 without it our team would not have as much fun as we've had over the years.
