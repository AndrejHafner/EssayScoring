  Dog @CAPS1 Of @DATE1  @CAPS2 made me laugh every time I saw her droopy ears and pointy little nose. @CAPS2 was my best friend, my dog. @CAPS3 brought me happiness every moment I was with her. Barking at the squirrels in the backyard to keeping me warm at night. All the crazy stuff that amazing dog did, brought a smile to my face. The laughter and joy to my heart.  Every @DATE1 when we went camping with the @PERSON1 family, we had to bring her with us. We had to bring her her own sleeping bag and camping chair to sit in. After a long day of swimming and walking around the lake,@CAPS2 would hop up in her chair and go to sleep by the warm fire. When we walked with the other families dog @PERSON2, @CAPS3 would carry her own leash like in her mouth like I would've been holding it. Every little thing @CAPS2 did differently than the average dog made us laugh. @CAPS2 was "@CAPS4," as we called her. @CAPS3 also loved to "log." @CAPS2 pulled around giant logs or sticks in the water and chewed on them until there was nothing left but back. All of the grandparents loved her too. Grandpa had special cookies just for her because @CAPS2 didn't like just any cookie. The time @CAPS2 went over to his house on his birthday wearing her own party hat, jumping on his lap to give him a birthday kiss. He laughed so hard his eyes started to water. Every time we went somewhere the other grandma would beg to "@CAPS6-sit," @CAPS3. Che loved her so much. When @CAPS2 was there @CAPS2 didn't get a kennel or a dog bed, @CAPS2 got the couch. @CAPS2 would take @CAPS3 into town to buy her a cheeseburger and go to the park.  I taught her to do tricks like the @LOCATION1 where @CAPS2 bounced on her hind legs in circles, and I also taught her @CAPS16 to speak. I would say "@CAPS9's on top a house?" "@CAPS10. (@CAPS11)," "who was the greatest @CAPS12 player ever?" "@CAPS10 (@CAPS14 @CAPS15)," and "@CAPS16 does sandpaper feel?" "@CAPS10." That made everyone laugh. We would spend hours doing nothing but tricks and playing in the back yard.  Our family took her on @CAPS9 we called "@CAPS3 @CAPS1," to the river to go swim and fish with us. @CAPS2 had fun running and splashing with us in the water. We also took her to the coast to play on the beach.We took her everywhere with us, and @CAPS2 loved it. @CAPS2 was also the only dog at the park that knew @CAPS16 to slide. Everyone was so amazed at @CAPS9 @CAPS2 could do. They had never seen anything like her before.  @CAPS3 made many people laugh and smile when they saw her. @CAPS2 was my best friend and the smartest dog I knew. From going to the park to slide, camping and swimming to just being a lazy dog, @CAPS2 made me laugh. @CAPS2's gone now, but her memory still remains. @CAPS2 will never be forgotten.
