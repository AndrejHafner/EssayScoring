 My high school @CAPS1 basketball team isn't the best team, but the one thing that we do have, is the ability to make each other laugh. At the start of @DATE1 the school held try outs and the teams were decided. After graduating seniors and some players not coming out, or team was brand new. Full with all different ages of players. we all were civil with each other at practices but we weren't all best friends that wanted to hang out outside of practice. The @CAPS1 team decided to take a retreat to the beach and stay @CAPS2 for a weekend.  When we went to leave to the beach our phones were taken and we had assigned seats in the cars. This trip seemed like it was going to be a long one with out my phone. We arrived at the house @TIME1. As we all found somewhere to relax, shower or sleep myself and most of the team ended up in the living room conversing with the coaches. we all sat on the floor recalling stories about the game from that @TIME1 or funny stories from our past. By the time we finished telling stories it had reached @TIME2 and everyone in the house was either tired or hungry.  As we sat on the floor complaining about tiredness or hunger we all started to turn our attention to @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 was starting to go on a tirade about how hungry she was. In her opinion she thought the house we were staying in should of already been stoked with food for us for when we got @CAPS2, but @CAPS2 was no food. As she continued on her rant she became more and more mad which made us laugh harder and harder. Finally she reached her point. "@CAPS2's no steak or chicken up in these mother freak-in cabinets." @PERSON1 proclaimed. At that point the coaches and players started laughing uncontrollable. @PERSON1 didn't understand why it was so funny, but we kept laughing and laughing at the fact that she just said that @CAPS2 should be steak and chicken in the cabinets. The outburst of laughter continued on for the next five to ten minutes.  When we finally started to calm down @PERSON2 came down stairs. She had missed everything that had happened and as we went to fill her in @LOCATION1 stopped us. "@PERSON2 @CAPS4 up on the counter and look in the cabinet," @PERSON1 said. @PERSON2 hesitantly got up on the counter and slowly started to open the cabinet. When she opened the cabinet she looked inside and all she could see was chips. She turned around and looked at @LOCATION1. "@CAPS3?" asked @PERSON2. As she turned to @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 just sat @CAPS2 smiling. Then she finally answered the question. "@CAPS4 me some of those chips right @CAPS2!" @PERSON1 said.  Everyone in the room started laughing as @PERSON2 was so confused to why she was asked to @CAPS4 on a counter just so she could @CAPS4 @PERSON1 chips, who had been sitting next to the counter the whole @TIME1. The whole basketball team started laughing again. @PERSON2 got down from the counter but with no chips in hand. We all continued laughing and kept talking about @CAPS3 had just happened for the next @NUM1 minutes.  As everyone finally started to settle into their beds for the @TIME1 @CAPS2 were still those moments of "@CAPS5 when this was said", and "@CAPS5 when she did this". That first @TIME1 that we spent at the beach did more for us then we realized. By going to the beach and making memories together we were brought together by two common things. The love for basketball, and most of all the ability to be able to come together as a team all because of the memories we shared that @TIME1 in the kitchen. Today we still @CAPS4 on each others nerves and sometimes we lose our tempers with another but, we will always laugh about the crazy things that happened on the trip but the thing we laugh about the most is @CAPS3 happened that @TIME1 in the kitchen.
