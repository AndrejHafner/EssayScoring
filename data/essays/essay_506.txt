 It was @DATE1. The day was beautiful and full of happy faces. A perfect day to be at the fair. I was sitting on a bench next to @PERSON1 this guy I really liked, but I doubted @CAPS6 liked me of course. I had caught him staring at me a couple of times and I just thought I had something on my face that really cached his attention, like a piece of food since we had just at a couple minutes before or something. I looked at him and asked "@CAPS1?""@CAPS2" @CAPS6 said with a huge smile on his face."@CAPS3 tell me @CAPS1 @CAPS14 funny" I demanded throwing a smile back at him."@CAPS2 is funny, but.." @CAPS6 paused for a moment."@CAPS5 can i ask @CAPS13 out?" @PERSON1 asked. I felt my face turn red, my body temperature raised and my leg began to move without control. "@CAPS6 cant know I have strong feelings for him" I thought to my self. "@CAPS7 just play it off like @CAPS10 hes joking..because @CAPS6 is joking right?""@CAPS8 @PERSON2? are @CAPS13 okay?" @CAPS6 asked as @CAPS6 put his hand on my lap."@CAPS9 I'm fine, its just.." I paused for a long time."@CAPS10 @CAPS13 say @CAPS3 I @CAPS17 understand" @CAPS6 said as his head slowly faced the ground. I didn't know @CAPS1 to say, I felt stuck. I wanted to say @CAPS14 much but the words wouldn't come out."@CAPS11 don't mess with me like that, I know your joking @PERSON1" I laughed nervously. @PERSON1 looked at me with a confused face like @CAPS10 @CAPS6 was saying "Was I not clear enough" or "@CAPS12 I just walk away?".  His smile turned into a serious expression and the glow of his eyes had disappeared. I felt something on my throat, words were stuck and they needed to come out!."@CAPS13 can ask me out any time and my answer @CAPS17 always be @CAPS9" I said feeling relived."@CAPS14 does that make @CAPS13 my girlfriend @PERSON2?""I don't know @PERSON1..@CAPS13 have not asked me out yet" I said with a grin on my face. We looked at each other for a second and busted out laughing, like @CAPS10 it was the funniest thing in the world. I didn't fully understand why we were laughing and @CAPS6 probably didn't either, but that didn't stop us. I started feeling a cramp in my stomach from all the force I was putting on my it which maid me to stop laughing. @PERSON1 took my hand and we walked towards the roller coaster ride. In my head I imagined him kneeling down on one knee and asking me to be his girlfriend, and at that moment the noises in the background would disappear, and the camera would only be focused on us. Although that probably only happens in the end of a romantic movie were everyone lives "happily ever after". I looked over at @PERSON1 realizing I wasn't in a movie, I was in this place called reality. @CAPS6 was looking at me like @CAPS10 I had something on my face again, but it didn't really bother me any more. We got on the roller coaster and a few other rides, which totally made me feel like I needed to throw up. I was standing in the ticket line wen for some reason I felt this joy inside of me, like @CAPS10 I was the happiest person on this world. @CAPS2 bothered me that day not even wen something was supposed to bother me, I just ignored it because I felt like @CAPS10 it really didn't matter. I had the biggest smile on my face like @CAPS10 I had just got bot-ox and couldn't make any other expression except for that one. The sun hid behind the clouds, and the day darkened right before my eyes. I had felt like the day hadn't been long enough because of all the fun I had been having. I was starting to believe that time really does fly, even though i knew better than that. The time to go home had come and the people heading out of the fair had exhausted looks that didn't even let them smile because they were @CAPS14 worn out. @PERSON1 and I walked towards the car. As we walked @CAPS6 seemed kind of worried. "@CAPS15 wrong @PERSON1" I asked noticing his not @CAPS14 happy expression. "I haven't officially asked @CAPS13 out" @PERSON1 said. "@CAPS16 ask me I'm ready" I repliedJorge hurried in front of me and stopped me from walking. "@CAPS17 @CAPS13 be my girlfriend @PERSON2..Again?" @CAPS6 grindButterflies ran down and up my stomach, and my feet weakened. "uhhhh..I mean @CAPS9 of course @CAPS7 be your girlfriend" I stuttered. I guess the expression on my face was hilarious or something because @CAPS6 began to giggle. @CAPS14 i decided to laugh too even though I didn't know @CAPS1 was funny but oh well. We got in the car and drove home. On the way it was kind of quiet but it was somehow worth it.
