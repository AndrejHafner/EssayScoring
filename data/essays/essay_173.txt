 A couple of months ago i was hanging out with my freind @CAPS1. It was a @DATE1 and i came to her to spend the @TIME1.At first we were extreamly bored so we went on a walk to go find something to do.We found our friend dylan at the skatepark and we stopped to talk to him for a while. After we had hung out there for about two hours we headed back up to her house.When we opened the door her sister started freaking out because we left so she got stucked with there younger brother @PERSON1. @CAPS1 didn't yell back, she didn't want the drama. Her sister got even more mad because jesssika was not showing a reaction to what her sister was doing. By ten minutes she exploded and started throwing herself around and freaking out. Me and @CAPS1 looked at each other and stated laughing really reallyhard because how funny her sister looked. @TIME1 after her mom had calmed the sistuation down, @CAPS1 and I made a @CAPS3 bed on her bedroom floor and when we were falling asleep we bothbursted out in laughter it was the funnest @TIME1 i have had in a long time.
