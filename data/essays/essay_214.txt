 One day my friends and I went to a friends house and we started playing @CAPS1 box we were laughing having an awesome time. My friend @CAPS2 started telling jokes and all my friends started laughing hysterically. My friend @CAPS3 was drinking milk at that time and @CAPS5 laughed so hard that milk started coming out of his nose, that was also funny but gross at the same time. @CAPS6 was the sad one of the whole group that was there, we all asked him, @CAPS4 was @CAPS5 so sad @CAPS5 answered that @CAPS5 heard that his girlfriend wanted to break up with him. So @CAPS5 asked us how to keep her interested, and we said that @CAPS5 should tell her some jokes to make her laugh. @CAPS5 said that @CAPS5 would think about it @CAPS6 was a real funny person and a blast to hang out with, so we didn't really worry about it so much, we thought that everything would be fine. So after all that @CAPS5 left and we started hanging out in my friend, @CAPS7's living room. We were hanging out and just talking about who was the hottest girl at school. So an hour past and my friend @CAPS6 came back. @CAPS5 came and sat with us and yelled I didn't work man, I was like okay calm down, @CAPS9 happened I asked?. @CAPS5 said, she didn't think it was funny she thought that I was being dumb and just plain silly. Oh did she really say silly that's not I word i thought she knew, everyone laughed, no @CAPS6 I was just messing with you man don't get mad come on now. So @CAPS6 left after @CAPS5 yelled at me, @CAPS5 left and all of us guys started laughing I thought that @CAPS5 was just but hurt and @CAPS5 would get over it. an hour past and my phone starts ringing and I look who's calling and it @CAPS6 s ex girlfriend. Surprised I answer and I tell her that @CAPS6 wasn't with us that I would tell him to call you later, I said that because @CAPS5 would use my phone to talk to her, but then she replied that she wanted to talk to me so I was like okay so we started talking and she is telling me that she likes me... I start cracking up in laughter. She got all sad and mad at me because of me laughing. But I told that it was cool that she did so I told her I have to go and we hanged up... I couldn't help my self i started cracking up again and so that's how my day ended in laughter and it was like that all day
