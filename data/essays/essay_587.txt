 I believe laughter is an important part of any relationship. In all my relationships whether it be friends,family,or a girlfriend laughter is always an important element of all of them.  the best relationship i have is with my best friend @PERSON1 and it is filled with laughter. We always have a great time together, like last @DATE1 when she and I went to snow peak with some friends and I tore ligaments in my knee when I jumped @PERSON2's quad. We laughed about me being stupid and getting hurt for it and we laughed about @CAPS1 big ears and how they make him look like @CAPS2 the elephant.  I think what makes us so close and such good friends is how much we make each other laugh. The first time we met she was dating one of my friends and the first thing I did was make her laugh and ever since then we have been awesome friends. Then she asked me if I wanted to work at the harvest fest, with her and I did and a made her laugh the whole time. Now I'm her dork and she is my best friend. The biggest thing I did to make her laugh at the harvest fest, was when I did a wheelie in the tractor down the whole track with a cowboy hat on and a huge dip of @LOCATION1 in my lip.  The moral of this story is the more you make people laugh the stronger and closer the relationships you will have whether it be with friends,family,or a significant other.
