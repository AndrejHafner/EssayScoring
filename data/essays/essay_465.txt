What's a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Laughter?  Would me and @PERSON1 be best friends @CAPS2 ever laughing? That would be a negative. I honestly think laughter is the biggest part of @CAPS1. What kind of @CAPS1 is two friends who never laugh? If there are any people in the world that don't laugh, I bet they don't have any friends, well at least true friends. I feel sorry for these people. I can't even imagine life @CAPS2 laughter. All of my friends and I laugh all the time. Especially with me and @PERSON1. When @PERSON1 and I are around each other, @CAPS5's usually non stop laughter. @PERSON1 and I laugh about almost everything. We have so many inside jokes its not even funny (well to me and her @CAPS5 is), such as "an upstairs @CAPS3 @CAPS4!" or "john, john, john, john". See there things people wouldn't think where funny, but whenever one of us blurts one of our stupid inside jokes out, we start laughing until we ball our eyes out. If I imagine me and @PERSON1 never laughing, then that would be the worst @CAPS1. I hate to even think about us never laughing. @CAPS5 sounds horrible. If me and @PERSON1 never laughed, then we most likely would not be friends. I'm so glad I have so much laughter in my life. I don't know what I would do @CAPS2 @CAPS5.
