 The @CAPS1 @CAPS2     I was sitting in the living room with @CAPS3 family talking about how every @ORGANIZATION1 we always end up laughing. One @ORGANIZATION1 we were out at @CAPS3 great grandpas house, and we just got done opening our presents, and in the middle of the floor was a @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 cousin @ORGANIZATION2 thought @CAPS3 dad was inside the @CAPS2.   At first we tried to convince @ORGANIZATION2 that @CAPS3 dad was out side talking to @CAPS3 uncle. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't believe us, even though @CAPS3 dad was outside talking. @ORGANIZATION2 circled the @CAPS2, and observed the @CAPS2 and was convinced @CAPS3 dad was in it.  Then @ORGANIZATION2 started poking the @CAPS2. We were laughing because it was so cute that @ORGANIZATION2 thought @CAPS3 dad was in the @CAPS2. He kept saying "I know he is in there." @ORGANIZATION2 opened the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad was not in there. @CAPS3 dad walked in to the house and asked why we were laughing. We told him the story and he started laughing too. Later on in the @TIME1 @ORGANIZATION2 was playing in the other room and wanted to show @CAPS3 dad the toy he was playing with. So @CAPS3 dad climbed in the @CAPS2 and we told @ORGANIZATION2 that @CAPS3 dad was outside. @ORGANIZATION2 went outside to look for him but @CAPS3 dad wasn't there.   When @ORGANIZATION2 came inside he looked in every room and could not find @CAPS3 dad. After a while @ORGANIZATION2 was standing by the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad jumped out and scared @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 screamed like a little girl and we all laughed really hard.   @ORGANIZATION2 was mad at first then he started laughing too. At the time @ORGANIZATION2 was only five so when @CAPS3 dad jumped out at him he got really scared. @ORGANIZATION2 thought it would be funny to scare @CAPS3 dad so @ORGANIZATION2 hid in the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad came inside and we told @CAPS3 dad to look for @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS3 dad called his name looked in every room and pretended like he couldn't find @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 started laughing because @CAPS3 dad acted like he was going to sit on @ORGANIZATION2 and it made him laugh super hard. When @ORGANIZATION2 got out of the @CAPS2 he was like "how did you know I was in the @CAPS2?" @CAPS3 dad said "well you started laughing silly goose."   out of all the @ORGANIZATION1's i have had that @ORGANIZATION1 was the best @ORGANIZATION1 ever. That was the time laughter brought two people together.
