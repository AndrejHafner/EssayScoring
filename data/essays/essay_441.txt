I tend to always get myself into awkward situations with the people i love, but that's just life right? When your a kid you tend to be dramatic about every little thing, an to those who love you @DATE1 are trying to teach you something @DATE1 or lead you the right way. Or maybe that was just me, haha? I moved out of my dads, with a horrible bang. I wanted to live life my way, which was only pushing the people i needed most away. I realized that a little too late. But again, that's just life right? Just about @DATE1 i finally "rekindled the flame" with my dad again. It was the hardest thing to do, considering my step mom hates me. @DATE1 that's obviously never going to change. So that's just something i'll have to deal with. My dad @DATE1 i still had the most awkward relationship, till about a few months ago when we had gone on a fishing trip together. Standing there, casting away there was nothing said. We both consider ourselfves fairily humorous people, but even our jokes wern't breaking through the ice. We finally started making conversation @DATE1 he started to tell me about when i was a kid going @DATE1 visiting my mom for the first time, then coming back to my grandmas @DATE1 calling her a......bad word...but i wont say which one. My dad hasnt every really cursed around me before, i guess that's time away for you. It was pretty funny all these stories he was telling me, @DATE1 the way he was explaing them. That brought pretty happy laughter to us both. @DATE1 really brought us back together again.
